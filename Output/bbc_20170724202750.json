After the dust had settled, it transpired that the victims had been mistaken for child traffickers.  The trigger was a WhatsApp message that had gone viral, urging people to be careful of strangers as they most likely belonged to a \"child lifting gang\".  As the message passed on, police say hysteria increased. Villagers armed themselves and began attacking anyone they did not recognise, with tragic results.  Unlike in western countries, most of India's fake news spreads via WhatsApp and mobile phone messages, because for a majority of Indians, their first point of exposure to the internet is via their phone.  India's telecom regulatory commission says there are more than one billion active mobile phone connections in India, and millions of Indians have started getting online in a very short space of time.  \"Reach has exploded, thanks to the proliferation of smartphones and cheap data packages. Rumours spread further and faster,\" Pratik Sinha, the founder of Altnews.in told the BBC. `  \"Suddenly people from rural areas in particular are inundated with information and are unable to distinguish what is real from what is not. They tend to believe whatever is sent to them.\"  Mr Sinha is one of a handful of people trying to \"fight\" the scourge of fake news in India.  Formerly a software engineer, he now runs Altnews fulltime, funding it with his own savings and ad revenue.  Image copyright Pratik Sinha  Altnews fact checks viral stories circulating on social media and WhatsApp, verifies photographs and videos and also calls out stories by media organisations that may be based on fake news.  Stories he has debunked include a viral video claiming to show a Hindu girl being lynched by a Muslim mob. The video, Mr Sinha says, regularly does the rounds on WhatsApp with a plea to the receiver to send on the message with the hope that authorities will be pressurised into taking action.  But the video though horrific, is actually of a Guatemalan girl being beaten by a mob and is two years old.  In fact a majority of the videos, Mr Sinha has said, seem to be propagated by people with hardline sensibilities and many have an \"anti-Muslim\" slant.  * * *  ## Some tools to be a myth buster  Image copyright AFP Image caption The encryption technology used by WhatsApp makes it hard to track fake news propagated on the site    * Google reverse image search is favoured by all of the Indian myth-busters. It allows you to upload an image online and then search for where it may have appeared in the past. You can either go to Google and do an image search or add the Google Search Image extension on to your Chrome browser.    * Tineye also allows readers to check if images have been manipulated.    * The free video to jpg converter transforms video into images that can then be searched separately. This can also be installed as a browser add-on.    * InVid has developed a browser application that allows people to add video links into it. It then provides detailed analysis about the video in question.  * * *  Part of the challenge, he adds, is that WhatsApp, which is the main medium of fake news in India, is \"like a mutating virus\".  \"WhatsApp has end to end encryption. What that means is every message sent between two parties has a unique set of keys, regardless of whether it is the same message being passed on. This means that when fake news happens, there is no trail. It becomes tough for even WhatsApp to track.\"  The other issue, according to Durga Raghunath, an Indian digital expert, is that people don't question sources on social networks or messaging apps.  \"The mental approach is different. Many of the issues people see on these platforms have an emotional connect, and because the information comes to us via family and friends, the inclination to double check is very low,\" she told the BBC.  Pankaj Jain, the man behind verification site SM Hoax slayer, knows this better than most. He told the BBC that his inspiration to bust hoaxes were the \"stupid rumours\" he kept receiving on WhatsApp.  Image copyright Pankaj Jain Image caption Pankaj Jain said he started his site because of the \"stupid rumours\" he kept getting  \"I began by responding to messages to tell people what they were passing on was not true, and then decided to take it further.\"  He came to prominence after becoming one of the first people to shoot down a viral news story which claimed that India's new 2,000 rupee note was embedded with a \"nano GPS chip\" that allowed authorities to track it if it was taken outside the country.  \"I did a lot of research and the thing that jumped out at me the most was that nano-GPS chips need a power source to function, which the new currency note very clearly did not have,\" he said.  His other notable \"busts\" include proving that a photograph tweeted out by a leading news channel purporting to be of two \"terrorists\" killed in Indian- administered Kashmir was actually a two-year-old photograph from Punjab, and more recently, explaining that a viral WhatsApp forward of the Indian flag flying atop the Israeli parliament only happened on Photoshop.  Shammas Oliyath, who runs the verification site Check4spam.com is another \"warrior\" in the battle against fake news.  His content is divided into several categories such as \"internet rumours\" and \"promotions\", but he says most of the news he deals with tends to be politically related.  Image copyright AFP Image caption India has more than a billion active phone connections  He gets about 200 WhatsApp inquiries a day, a number that has picked up after he got a little publicity for forcing a media organisation to retract a story which claimed that the assets of wanted Indian gangster Dawood Ibrahim had been frozen.  Despite their best efforts however, all three men know that they simply cannot take on the exploding fake news system on their own.  Mr Sinha says Altnews has done roughly 3.2 million pageviews in five months, while SM Hoaxslayer gets about 250,000 pageviews a month. Mr Oliyath says Check4spam.com gets about 15,000 hits a day.  These numbers pale in comparison to mainstream media sites, and hardly make a dent in the hundreds of thousands of messages that get passed around every day.  Mr Oliyath rues the fact that India's mainstream media is a part of the problem.  \"In the rush to report first, there is no focus on fact checking,\" he says.  Ms Raghunath agrees.  \"Television in this country has always been tabloid and not serious. The state operated Doordarshan never took off, and the rest was always tabloid - which is to say, talking heads and live news reel,\" she said, adding that there is very little emphasis on process even in India's digital news ecosystem.  Image copyright Shammas Oliyath Image caption Shammas Oliyath (left) shot to prominence after forcing a media organisation to retract a story  What this means is that, a lot of the time, social and mainstream media feed off one another, fuelled by the desire for more eyeballs.  However, she says the larger issue is still one of media literacy and believes that the fight against fake news still needs to be led by mainstream legacy media.  \"People segment organisations into those they trust and those that they believe are there to entertain them. There is a higher onus on those that they trust to do more.\"  This, she says, could be as simple as breaking down an article and educating readers how they work.  \"It can be as basic as distinguishing an opinion piece from a news piece and breaking down articles and identifying things like sources, fact and analysis,\" she says.  As important, she says, is making the truth go viral.  \"We have to tackle this issue in a fun way, If people are consuming listicles, we need to do listicles, and if its memes, we need to do memes too. It's really important that we are not weird or academic about it\".

The investigation centres on the Cairn India oilfield in Barmer district and 25 people have been arrested.  Fifty million litres of oil were stolen over a six-year period and sold to two local factories, according to police.  Estimates suggest the crude taken could be worth more than $7m (\u00a35.3m).  District police chief Gangandeep Singla told AFP news agency that dozens more arrests could follow.  \"The company suspected something fishy was happening and complained to us, and during investigations we found this was an organised ring,\" he said.  ## Tankers seized  Tankers are used to take waste water from the oilfield. But those involved in the theft were filling two of the five compartments in each tanker with crude, the Hindustan Times reports.  Thirty-nine tankers were used for the theft and 33 have been seized, the paper quotes police as saying.

Her answer was unexpected.  \u201cYou don\u2019t have a brand,\u201d she responded during the question and answer session at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in May 2017.  > Don\u2019t package yourself - Sheryl Sandberg  \u201cI get this question a lot, and I shudder every time. Crest has a brand. Perrier has a brand. People are not that simple. When we are packaged, we\u2019re ineffective and inauthentic.\u201d  What we each have is a voice, she added, which can be complex, contradictory and sometimes wrong. Her advice? \u201cDon\u2019t package yourself.\u201d Just speak honestly, factually and from your own experience.  Sandberg is one of the most powerful figures in social media, and it\u2019s social media that\u2019s has helped make the idea of personal branding so ubiquitous. So, has this phenomenon had its day? Sandberg may be ahead of the curve in rejecting the idea as absurd and dehumanising.  **Self and self-promotion**  The concept of building a personal brand dates back decades. In 1997, Fast Company published an article titled \u201cThe Brand Called You\u201d that popularised the concept, arguing that it wasn\u2019t just CEOs or celebrities that needed to carefully craft their image. It was everyone.  The rise of self-promotion and branding partnerships on social media means that it\u2019s now second nature for people to build a personal brand: to put some thought into the image they project online and the impression it gives to friends, clients, colleagues and even potential employers or sponsors.  > Self-promotion can be exhausting  That emphasis on presenting a strong public image is especially pronounced in these uncertain economic times; a growing, fiercely competitive \u201cgig economy\u201d has made digital profiles a crucial part of grabbing work opportunities. Freelancing has risen by 43% in the UK since 2008, according to an IPSE survey, and a report by the software company Intuit predicted that 40% of the United States workforce would be made up by independent workers by 2020.  _You might also like:_  \u201cPersonal branding is now being taught in Kazakhstan, Egypt and even Cambodia. All around the world, job counsellors are telling people to come up with three to four words that reflect their authentic self,\u201d according to Ilana Gershon, an associate anthropology professor at Indiana University Bloomington.  Traditional branding paints a picture of products that are flawless and consistent \u2013 think of famous brand slogans from \u201cNever knowingly undersold\u201d to \u201cThe best a man can get.\u201d Humans don\u2019t work that way, as Sandberg acknowledged. We are complicated and fallible. There\u2019s a risk that creating a \u201cperfect\u201d personal brand comes with enormous pressure to live up to it.  There has always been some unease with the idea that humans can be packaged, and personal brands often come under fire for being artificial portrayals of self-indulgent people. In 2012, the satirical online newspaper The Onion mocked the trend with the headline \u201c\u2018I Am A Brand,\u2019 Pathetic Man Says.\u201d  The story goes on to describe \u201ca sad, pathetic local web developer\u201d who \u201csees his worthless daily blog posts, endless Facebook status updates, and aggravating Foursquare check-ins as \u2018extensions of his brand name.\u2019\u201d The point the writer is making: no-one cares that much about the message we\u2019re trying to project. We\u2019ll be valued at work by doing a good job, not by attempting to project a consistently perfect image.  Self-promotion can also be exhausting.  \u201cWhen people are trying to create a personal brand\u2026 they must be always on,\u201d says Ilana Gershon, author of Down and Out in the New Economy. This might mean updating social media feeds several times a day with carefully curated content, palatable to the people they may want to socialise or work with.  This, she says, \u201cintroduces a new way of constantly policing yourself. It forces you to be far more instrumental about your personal life, seeing yourself as a perpetually performing for a business-driven gaze.\u201d  Competition to outperform rivals is made more acute by the fact that it\u2019s relatively cheap to buy artificially generated Facebook likes, Instagram followers, Twitter retweets, and all the other metrics of social-media success.  The British author Ella Woodward, who runs the healthy-eating blog Deliciously Ella and has more than a million Instagram followers, has spoken about her social-media burnout in interviews. \u201cIt\u2019s easy when you work in a digital world that doesn\u2019t stop, to never stop,\u201d she told the marketing magazine Campaign, \u201cand therefore share every aspect of your life. You can get quite exposed, and the bigger you are, the more you\u2019re going to attract criticism.\u201d  Against this backdrop, Sandberg\u2019s opinion of personal branding could signal the death knell of the concept.  **Communicating ****\u2018****you****\u2019**  Others, however, believe the idea has merit.  Jennifer Holloway, a personal-branding consultant who lives in the Yorkshire Dales, says the criticism is based on a misunderstanding. \u201cIt\u2019s not fakery,\u201d she says of creating a personal branding strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018What brand am I already?\u2019\u201d  > Don\u2019t expect to have a personal brand that everybody loves. It\u2019s about subtlety and authenticity  Holloway sees the process in practical terms. People form an idea of you based on what you say, how you act and what you look like, anyway. Why not spend some time thinking about your best qualities and idiosyncrasies, so that your online profiles are warm, genuine and positive, and you have a clear answer to questions like, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d  Her key advice: \u201cDo not try to second guess, \u2018What kind of person would this employer like and how do I become that?\u2019 Don\u2019t expect to have a personal brand that everybody loves. It\u2019s about subtlety and authenticity.\u201d She also advises against going overboard, saying that it\u2019s better to stick to one social-media platform and do it well than to stretch yourself too thin.  Molly Crist and Katerina Clauhs Dhand have figured out how to strike this balance. Two millennial-age sisters from Philadelphia in the US who launched a boutique travel company, Onward Travel, in 2014, they share some of Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s scepticism about personal branding while realising that they can\u2019t avoid it completely.  Visitors to the website can watch a video of the sisters eating pho, drinking margaritas, and describing their upbringing on a farm in Pennsylvania, where their mother and grandmother had been running cookery classes since the early 1990s. \u201cIt could be much more polished,\u201d Dhand says, \u201cbut it shows who we are, it\u2019s a little silly. I hope it communicates that we\u2019re real people and that inspires trust.\u201d  > It\u2019s not worthwhile to push the personal branding past a certain point  Crist acknowledges that \u201cit\u2019s important to communicate our story and ourselves to our customers,\u201d but says it\u2019s not worthwhile to push the personal branding past a certain point. For example, Onward Travel is on the usual social media platforms, but, Crist explains, \u201cit\u2019s not our number one priority. We have learned that they take an incredible amount of time and thought to manage, and neither of us are overly inclined to share online in the first place.\u201d  She\u2019s glad that, unlike some influencers or life coaches who are reliant on self-promotion, \u201cwe are ultimately selling a guided tour, we\u2019re not selling ourselves.\u201d  _To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our_\u00a0Facebook_ page or message us on _Twitter.  _If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features _**_newsletter_**_\u00a0called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

The child is reported to be 26 weeks pregnant and doctors say her body is not developed enough to carry a baby.  Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors confirm the mother's life is in danger.  The girl alleges she was raped several times in the past seven months by her uncle, who has been arrested.  Her pregnancy was only recently discovered when her parents took her to hospital after she complained of stomach pain.  She will be examined on Wednesday by Chandigarh's Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. Its doctors will advise the Supreme Court on how much risk to her life she faces by either carrying the baby to term or having an abortion.  Last week, a district court in the northern city of Chandigarh in Punjab turned down her parents' petition to allow the child to abort.  The tough law against abortion was introduced in 1971 to prevent illegal and unsafe abortions and curb maternal mortality, and the restrictions remain an important weapon in India's fight against a skewed gender ratio which has resulted from a deep-seated cultural preference for sons. Millions of female foetuses have been aborted over the years by pregnant women after undergoing foetal gender testing.  But in recent years, Indian courts have been inundated with petitions, many from child rape survivors, wanting to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks, the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says.  In most such cases, the pregnancy is not even discovered until after the 20-week period is over because the children are themselves unaware of their condition, our correspondent adds.  In May, a court in Haryana state asked medical experts to take a call on a similar plea and a panel of doctors decided to carry out the termination.  In the latest case, doctors who have already examined the girl found her pelvic bones had not fully developed because of her age and said the life of both mother and baby were at \"very serious risk\", lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava says in his petition.  \"Medical experts have categorically opined that if the 10-year-old is forced to give birth, either through normal delivery or even through caesarean- section, it may be fatal to the life of the rape survivor as well as to her child,\" the petition says.  In his public interest petition, he has also asked the Supreme Court to issue guidelines to deal with such cases in future, by ordering the authorities to set up teams of experts in every district to take quick decisions in cases involving child rape survivors.  Indian media reports say a psychiatrist, who was part of the team of doctors who met the girl, has said that \"she doesn't understand that she is pregnant or the implications of being pregnant\".  The girl belongs to an extremely poor family, her father is a government employee and mother works as a domestic help.  Medical experts say girls can start menstruating and ovulating at nine, but their bodies are not mature enough for pregnancy at that age.  India is home to the largest number of sexually abused children globally, with some campaigners saying it has reached epidemic proportions. But there's a general reluctance to talk about the problem and it's rarely discussed in public.  Studies have shown that in large numbers of cases the abusers are known to the children and include care-givers like parents, relatives and teachers.  * * *  Image copyright AFP  ## The scale of abuse in India    * A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours   * More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015   * 240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18    * 53.22% of children who participated in a government study reported some form of sexual abuse   * 50% of abusers are known to the child or are \"persons in trust and care-givers\"   _Sources: Indian government, Unicef_  * * *", "newsHeadline": "India court hears 10-year-old rape victim's abortion plea - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40702252", "countriesMentioned": ["British Indian Ocean Territory", "India", "United States", "Canada"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"}
