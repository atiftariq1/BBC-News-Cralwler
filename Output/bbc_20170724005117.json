A BBC reporter at the scene says the immediate vicinity has been locked down but authorities have not released details.  Media reports citing security sources say one Jordanian was killed and one Israeli seriously injured.  Israeli authorities are believed to be evacuating embassy staff.  The heavily protected embassy is located in the Rabiyeh neighbourhood, an affluent part of Amman.  On Friday, thousands of Jordanians protested in Amman against Israel over the installation of metal detectors at a site sacred to both Muslims and Jews in Jerusalem.  Jordan is the custodian of Muslim religious sites in the city.  Israeli authorities are not commenting on the incident and have imposed reporting restrictions.

A battle that began 266 days ago has finally concluded with intense house-to-house fighting and a last stand on the western bank of the River Tigris.  In a sense, the battle ended where it started.  On 6 June 2014, IS forces staged a diversionary attack in northern Mosul that was intended to draw Iraqi forces away from a prison break in a town called Badush, 16km (10 miles) north-west of the city.  Just over three years later, IS made its last stand there.  The reduction of the last IS pocket in Mosul was a true battle of annihilation. Unlike in prior battles, such as Tikrit and Falluja, the siege did not witness a breakout or withdrawal by IS fighters.  Estimates suggest that IS fielded about 1,000 fighters in eastern Mosul and another 2,000 in western Mosul. The vast majority of them will have been killed in the intense fighting, making the battle the most costly defeat suffered by IS.  ## Politics and reconstruction  The clearance of Mosul will provide a political boost for a number of actors. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi can expect to be strengthened by the liberation, as will key commanders such as Lt-Gen Abdul Wahab al-Saadi of the Counter-Terrorism Service.  Rival pro-government forces, such as the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization units, or PMU) will seek to stress their role in peripheral operations such as the drive to the Syrian border.  With an eye towards Iraq's 2018 national elections, Iranian-backed Shia PMU commanders such as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis - a US-designated global terrorist - and Hadi al-Ameri will want to share the political limelight with Prime Minister Abadi.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption There are fears of retribution against suspected IS sympathisers in Mosul  In Mosul, there will be a major requirement for reconciliation and reconstruction.  The city may not be included in forthcoming provincial elections because of the difficulty of holding polls in a post-conflict environment, but there is an urgent need for a higher co-ordination council to oversee it and other parts of Nineveh province.  One option may be the appointment of a popular and trusted figure such as Gen Saadi as an interim co-ordinator.  Transitional justice is a key issue, because IS fighters from Mosul and its rural outskirts may have blended back into the population and public demand for vengeance will be strong.  Mosul also needs physical reconstruction, a task that has barely begun even in the parts of the city that were retaken eight months ago at the battle's outset.  On 5 July, Lise Grande, the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Iraq, estimated that emergency reconstruction of the city would cost more than $1bn.  ## Pockets of IS  New military challenges loom for Iraq even as the battle ends in Mosul. Just 65km west of the city lies the smaller Tal Afar, which remains under IS control.  Forces from the Mosul battle are already being dispatched to Tal Afar to begin the clearance of that city. Covering less than one-eighth the surface area of Mosul, Tal Afar is a long-term stronghold of IS and may still require weeks or months of fighting to liberate.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Despite losing Mosul, IS still holds territory in Iraq  Some 290km to the south-west of Mosul, IS also holds a string of towns in Anbar province along the Iraqi portion of the River Euphrates.  Collectively known as al-Qaim, these towns are closely connected to the remaining IS strongholds in the Euphrates valley in Syria, such as Raqqa and Deir al-Zour.  Unless IS suffers a catastrophic collapse of military capacity - which is possible at this culminating phase of the campaign - then the Tal Afar and al- Qaim battles could still consume much of the rest of 2017.  ## New insurgency?  There is also evidence that jihadist group has seamlessly made the transition back into an insurgent movement.  A burgeoning IS insurgency has flared up in areas that were retaken from it over two years ago. They include Diyala province, where Iranian-backed militias have thrown fuel on the fire by undertaking collective punishment of the Sunni Arab community, human rights campaigners say.  Image copyright AFP Image caption IS could now step up car and suicide bomb attacks  In Mosul itself, we can see the future of the IS presence in the way the movement has adapted its operations within recently liberated areas.  Timed to coincide with the start of Eid al-Fitr celebrations, IS launched five attempted mass casualty bombing attacks in eastern Mosul on 23-24 June, and the group briefly overran a small area of western Mosul on 26 June with a large-scale raid involving more than 30 fighters.  IS is likely to use these kind of tactics - and large bombings of Shia pilgrims near Baghdad during religious festivals later this year - to offset the military losses they have suffered.  Iraq's battle against IS is set to shift from the open battlefield to the shadowy realm of counter-terrorism raids in the cities, deserts and borders.  _Dr Michael Knights is the Lafer Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

While promising a fierce fight to the end, IS prepared the way in its propaganda for its military defeat in the city.  The group began to shift its messaging in May 2016 amid losses in its Iraqi and Syrian heartland, saying that victory was not determined by territorial hold but persistence in faith.  It emphasised its enduring ideological reach, insisting that the group was invincible even if it faced what it portrayed as temporary setbacks on the ground.  IS cited a military official as saying the group had begun readying for its battle to defend Mosul from the first day it captured the city, suggesting the group knew its hold on the city could never last.  ## Eyes elsewhere  Following the launch by Iraqi forces of the operation to recapture Mosul in October 2016, IS has played up the strength of its affiliates in other countries.  It recently suggested that the capture of parts of the city of Marawi in the Philippines by pro-IS militants in May was reminiscent of its capture of Mosul, indicating that the symbolic centre of its so-called \"caliphate\" could be revised.  Image caption Pro-IS militants remain holed up in Marawi despite an operation by the Philippine military  The group noted that a precursor had lost control of areas of Iraq in 2007 but resurfaced much stronger.  IS has demonstrated its ability to carry out attacks in various parts of Iraq outside Mosul, with a current offensive near Qayyara to the south of the city diverting attention from its crumbling \"caliphate\".  It has issued multiple calls for attacks worldwide, and in June claimed a third attack in the UK and its first attacks in Iran and Israel.  ## Graveyard  In the course of the battle for Mosul, IS has often said the city would prove to be a graveyard for its enemies.  But on 7 July it described Mosul's Old City as a graveyard for thousands of civilians, blaming their suffering on US-led coalition bombardment.  Image copyright Telegram/Amaq Image caption IS claimed the destruction of the al-Nuri mosque was a message from the US to Sunni Muslims  This served its narrative depicting an alleged global war against Sunni Islam.  IS used the destruction in Mosul - including the landmark Great Mosque al-Nuri and Hadba minaret, reportedly orchestrated by the group itself - to serve its own ends.  It boasted about the fierce resistance its members had put up in the city over almost nine months, against an array of powerful enemies.  It also gloated about the material and human cost visited upon its foes.  In a recent recognition of its demise in Mosul, the group said it planned to apply lessons derived from the protracted battle to future fronts in its unending war.  These are just some of the ways its media spins victory out of military defeats.  BBC Monitoring_ reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The aircraft crashed in 1944 after getting hit by anti-aircraft fire, killing co-pilot, Ernest Vienneau.  > \u201cIn years to come, many of the ships and aircraft lost during the World Wars will be gone forever.\u201d  Diving such sites can be both \u201cexhilarating and spectacular\u201d and \u201csombre and sad\u201d when there has been loss of life, says Jones; something that hit home particularly hard on this shoot.  The images Jones captured ended up having a surprisingly personal impact after he entered the photographs in the Underwater Photographer of the Year awards. His entry was published and spotted by the late co-pilot's family who got in touch with Jones.  \u201cThey had never seen images of his resting place,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThe follow-on correspondence meant even more to me than the dive itself.\u201d  \u201cFrom descending into the massive cylindrical turret armour of the WW1 Battleship HMS Audacious, to seeing the deck of the WW2 wreck SS Empire Heritage covered in Sherman tanks, I\u2019m frequently left in awe of what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he says.  But these relics from one of the bloodiest chapters in human history are slowly disappearing.  \u201cIn years to come many of the ships and aircraft lost during the World Wars will be gone forever,\u201d says Jones.  Since wrecks deteriorate over time, he says, photographing them is \u201ccapturing a point in history that will never be seen again\u201d.  > \u201cUnderwater photography and scuba diving is a form of meditation.\u201d  \u201cWhen you dive on a wreck that has lain on the seabed, sometimes over a hundred years, it's like time stood still,\u201d says **Anders Nyberg**, a freelance photographer from the Swedish island of Gotland.  His favourite technique is to showcase familiar objects in the strange, other- worldly setting of the deep.  \u201cIt may be a door handle, a vase or a binocular, furniture or a wall with a tool that hangs neatly left on the wall. It is so I like it, untouched, to get the best pictures,\u201d he says.  Wreck sites like the SS Thistlegorm, one of the world\u2019s best-known wrecks, are among his favourite to photograph, as the area\u2019s diverse marine life and beautiful corals make rich, wide-angle photography subjects.  Nyberg\u2019s most startling experience, though, was not one he managed to capture on camera.    He and his wife were diving SS President Coolidge, which sank in 1942 off the island Esparto Santo, Vanuatu, when the cargo rooms became flooded with blue flashing lights.  \u201cSlowly we were totally surrounded by this glitter and I became completely disorientated,\u201d he says.  The peculiar blue lights turned out to be the biolumiscent eyes of a school of fish. The phenomenon \u2013 thought to attract or illuminate prey \u2013 can only be seen in total darkness, so turning on a torch would have stopped the effect.  Nyberg\u2019s advice for getting the perfect underwater shot is to master your diving and camera equipment before going into the water. For safety it is important to use a line to follow out, in case visibility is poor.  Diving on wrecks is both exciting and physically and mentally demanding, but it can also be \u201ca form of meditation, to relax from the stress of everyday life and work\u201d.  Photographer, designer, and author, **Jennifer Idol** is the first woman to dive 50 states in her native US.  \u201cI particularly enjoy large intact wrecks that are historic and not artificial reefs. Each wreck tells a story,\u201d Idol says.  **1\\. Respect War Graves**   Treat wrecks with the respect you would give a churchyard.  **2\\.

Using models in an image helps show the scale of a wreck.\u201d  Creating a powerful image takes planning. Idol says it is important photographers consider \u201corientation, condition, and depth\u201d before a shoot.  \u201cA ship can be too large to see on one dive, especially when setting up a photo. Usually, descent lines are set in place or boats are moored to a line from which you follow to the wreck.  \u201cIf you are creating images inside the wreck, it is important to first become familiar with the wreck and then also to follow necessary diving procedures for penetration. This may include setting lines or diving mixed gases and using redundant diving systems.\u201d  Even to someone as experienced as Idol, wrecks can yield surprises.  \u201cI am sometimes surprised to find schools of fish, invertebrates, and even eels deep inside wrecks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe life inside a wreck is surprising because it feels remote, is dark, and evades currents.\u201d  > \u201cIt is very nice\u2026to see how the sea makes from a huge piece of steel a new house for fishes\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s very special to feel you are in a place where some years ago there was people cruising the seas on it. I can imagine a lot of stories about it,\u201d says **Jordi Benitez**, a banker from Spain who started in underwater photography 12 years ago.  \u201cIt is very nice too, to see how the sea makes from a huge piece of steel a new house for fishes, and how a new ecosystem is created around the wreck.\u201d  Benitez\u2019 subjects have included the Dragonera in Tarragona \u2013 a large ship sunk in the 1990s as an underwater tourism attraction \u2013\u00a0and in the Red Sea the Chrisoula K and Thistlegorm. The former is a cargo ship that struck a reef and sank in the 1980s, and the latter a British wartime ship that was attacked and sunk in 1941, killing nine people. The Thistlegorm wreck was discovered in the 1950s.  \u201cI love to dive in the SS Thistlegorm because there are still a lot of materials from WW2,\u201d says Benitez. \u201cYou can see bikes, trucks, trains, wings of planes... You feel as [though] you were travelling 70 years back.\u201d  His advice for capturing effective underwater photographs is to use a \u201cvery wide-angle lens\u201d and to \u201cplay with the light\u201d.  \u201cIn underwater photography, we use many times strobes and artificial light, but in wrecks, it\u2019s very nice to play with natural light, this gives also a special atmosphere to the pictures.\u201d  _For more incredible ocean stories, follow\u00a0OurBluePlanet\u00a0on Twitter.

And high-profile international league tables are a very public form of this pecking order.  While these might measure a whole range of factors - from reputation and staff ratios to research output - what they do not compare is the ability of students who have been taught in these universities.  But the OECD, in its annual Education at a Glance, has published test results comparing the ability of graduates in different countries.  And it shows a very different map of higher education than the ranking tables, which are dominated by US and UK universities, such as Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge and UCL.  The OECD tested literacy skills among graduates - and the high-flyers were not in the US or UK, but in Japan and Finland.  These figures, based on test results rather than reputation, show a very different set of nationalities from the usual suspects.  **The OECD's top 10 highest performing graduates**    1. Japan   2. Finland   3. Netherlands   4. Sweden   5. Australia   6. Norway   7. Belgium   8. New Zealand    9. England   10. United States  None of the countries in the top places make much of an appearance in conventional university rankings.  But while the names of US Ivy League universities are familiar around the world, Norwegian and Australian universities seem to be turning out more capable graduates.  In the QS World University Rankings, there were 32 US universities in the top 100, but only one from New Zealand.  But graduates from New Zealand are higher achieving than their US counterparts.  Image copyright iStock Image caption Oxford was named the world's top university in the Times Higher Education rankings  There is also the question of cost - and the return on investment in higher education for both students and taxpayers.  The Dutch university system, with low fees, outperforms the United States and England, which charge much higher tuition fees.  Scotland and Wales are not included in this OECD measure, but Northern Ireland is in 14th place.  It casts a light too on how an efficient school system might not translate into success in higher education.  South Korea and Singapore, both high achievers at school level, are below average in the graduate rankings.  And what does it mean for the value of university degrees in countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece, who are languishing at the bottom of these graduate test results?  Image copyright iStock Image caption Japan's graduates were the highest performing in OECD tests  Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, says the results show ability levels can \"vary hugely among people with similar qualifications\".  They might all have degrees, but \"there are major differences in the quality of higher education\".  \"When it comes to advanced literacy skills, you might be better off getting a high school degree in Japan, Finland or the Netherlands than getting a tertiary degree in Italy, Spain or Greece,\" says Mr Schleicher.  Image copyright iStock Image caption The OECD rankings were based on tests of students, rather than factors such as university reputation  These OECD test results may be completely different from conventional university rankings, but the two sets of findings are not incompatible, says Ben Sowter, director of the QS World University Rankings.  While the OECD has compared standards across national higher education systems, the university rankings are focused on an elite group of individual universities.  Mr Sowter says if every university in the US was measured in rankings, it would show \"they have a share of the worst as well as the best\".  The US has a highly polarised education system, but that is not apparent from a ranking system that focuses only on the top.  **QS World University Rankings 2016-17**    1. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)   2. Stanford University   3. Harvard University   4. University of Cambridge   5. California Institute of Technology (Caltech)   6. University of Oxford   7. University College London   8. ETH Zurich   9. Imperial College London   10. University of Chicago  The success of a country such as Finland in the quality of its graduates could owe as much to its school system as its universities, Mr Sowter says.  And it is likely to be \"harder to run a bad university in Finland than in the US\".  But Mr Sowter says the OECD findings highlight a longstanding question about priorities for higher education.  Should countries invest in making sure there is a good overall standard - or should they focus on cultivating a few world-leading institutions?  There would be a good economic case for arguing for a consistently high standard across all universities rather than a landscape of peaks and valleys.  * * *  More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch  * * *  University rankings can highlight differences between individual institutions, but Mr Sowter says they cannot be used to evaluate how well a higher education system is performing.  The OECD runs the Pisa tests, which compare standards in secondary schools in more than 70 countries.  And there was an attempt by the think tank to set up a higher education version, so that comparisons could be made between individual universities.  Image copyright iStock Image caption Universities such as Harvard have dominated international rankings  But universities, particularly in the US, were not at all keen, and there seems little imminent sign of university league tables based on the quality of the students they produce.  Even though there might be scepticism about how international league tables are calculated, there is no avoiding their importance, when universities have to compete as much as brands as academic institutions.  When Oxford was named for the first time this year at the top of the Times Higher Education world rankings, it was headline news.

This hunting strategy has proven so effective that orb-weaving spiders are one of the most successful groups of animals. They are found in almost every corner of the world and there are more than 3,000 species.  Making a web is a fairly sophisticated ploy. As well as multiple forms of silk and glue, the spider needs to perform a sequence of precise manoeuvres.  But why bother building your own web, when you can just invade somebody else's and devour the architect?  A clandestine group of spiders known as \"pirates\" have adopted this nefarious method of nabbing their prey. Their hunting strategies are among the most remarkable in the animal kingdom.  Pirate spiders are members of **the spider group** that includes all the \"orb weavers\" \u2013 those that make the prototypical, circular webs we are all familiar with \u2013 but they do not make webs.  In fact, they have lost the ability. They can still produce silk, which they use to build egg sacs and wrap prey. But they are anatomically incapable of spinning a web. The number of silk \"spigots\" on their spinnerets is dramatically small compared to their relatives.  Instead, they invade the webs of other spiders, in a bid to lure and then kill the hapless architect. Gently, they pluck the strings of the web, enticing the host to approach.  Once the host spider has ventured close enough, the pirate makes its move.  First, it encloses its duped prey within its two enormous front legs. These are fringed with massive spines, called \"macrosetae\", which they use to trap the host within a prison-like basket.  Then, the final move: the pirate bites its prey and uses its fangs to inject a powerful venom that instantly immobilises it.  It is a powerfully effective hunting technique.  \"It\u00a0can be riveting\u00a0to watch a pirate stealthily wandering while waving its long, first pair of legs to narrow in on the location of the other spider,\" says **Mark Townley** of the University of New Hampshire. \"Despite many hours spent feeding pirates for our studies on spinnerets, I never became jaded by the sight of them searching for and attacking prey. It was always a marvel to watch. They can wield that first pair of legs so delicately that I've seen them touch\u00a0prey spiders so lightly without\u00a0them reacting in any way, not seeming to even notice.\"  But we do not yet fully understand how the pirate's strategy works.  In particular, it is not clear why the pirate spiders pluck the strings of the host spider's web.  It has long been assumed that the plucking mimics the vibrations caused by an ensnared insect. Hence the Latin name for pirate spiders: Mimetidae, or \"imitator\".  However, not all entomologists agree that this is what the pirate spiders are doing.  \"The behaviour of resident spiders towards pirate spiders and their own prey is quite different, as are the vibrations in the web caused by these two sources,\" says **Carl Kloock** of California State University Bakersfield.  He has an alternative suggestion. \"It seems to me most likely that pirate spiders are mimicking the vibrations of web-invading spiders of the same species, and possibly spiders of different species,\" says Kloock. \"A spider on its web needs to defend its web \u2013 a valuable resource \u2013 from other spiders, who may try to take over the web to avoid the cost of building their own web, or simply try to steal prey from the web.\"  \"These encounters follow a pretty simple pattern, where the spiders signal at one another, then slowly approach each other, usually until the smaller spider gives up and flees the web.  \"I think what the pirate spiders are doing is basically sending a deceptive signal representing themselves as small web invaders that refuse to flee, drawing the resident closer and closer until they are within attack range,\" Kloock adds.\u200b \u200b  Then there is the matter of pirate spider venom, which has evolved to be extremely toxic towards other spiders, including members of their own species, but not towards other animals.  \"Once another spider has been bitten it ceases to move, whereas fruit flies may struggle for several minutes,\" says **Daniel Mott **of Texas A&amp;M International University. \"Their toxins appear to be very specific to other spiders.\"  Why, and how, could such a strange hunting strategy evolve?  The first problem is that the prey spiders are also predators, equipped with fangs and venom. This means they are more dangerous than, say, beetles or flies, and also less abundant.  Secondly, pirate spiders are specialist predators. While they do sometimes feast on other prey, their main source of food is always spiders. By comparison, most orb-weaving spiders are generalist predators, eating whatever wanders into their web.  In fact, pirates are not even capable of capturing other spiders without the web to stand on.  \"In the lab, if you put an orb weaver into a jar but don't allow it to spin a web, the pirate spider will not attack it,\" says **Danilo Harms** of the University of Hamburg in Germany. \"It needs a web in order to capture another spider.\"  Somehow, the ancestors of pirate spiders both lost the ability to weave their own webs, and became predators of other spiders to boot.  Harms says the most plausible explanation is that it began with thievery. Pirate spiders' ancestors may have started invading the webs of other spiders, in order to steal the insects that the host had painstakingly trapped, poisoned and stored.  This filching behaviour has a colourful name: \"kleptoparasitism\".  Some of the proto-pirates could have then taken this tactic to the next level, by preying on the host spiders themselves. Over time, they would then have become increasingly specialised for capturing other spiders: evolving unusually long front legs, sophisticated web-plucking behaviours, and spider- specific venom.  This idea has been dubbed the \"kleptoparasitism-origin hypothesis\".  Whatever the reason for their quirky behaviour, pirate spiders are highly successful. Scientists have formally described more than 160 species, and they are found on every continent except Antarctica.  \"We know a little bit about the biology of a tiny fraction of pirate spiders, but for most of the species we know literally nothing about their life history and behaviour,\" says Gustavo Hormiga of George Washington University. \"For example, virtually nothing is known about the biology of the beautifully bizarre South American tropical pirate spiders of the genus _Gelanor_.\"  In this genus, the males' pedipalps \u2013 modified legs, which they use for inseminating females \u2013 are twice the length of the male's body. It may be that this allows them to inseminate females from a distance. \"In all other spiders, copulation requires that both partners are close to each other,\" says Hormiga. Mating at a distance would be a useful precaution, as pirate spiders are aggressive, possess potent venom, and are primed to prey on other arachnids, including their own kind.  But they also have a gentler side.  In a study published in November 2016 in the journal _Cladistics_, Hormiga and his student **Ligia Benavides **described five new species. Their study also featured the first report of female pirate spiders caring for their young.  Maternal care is relatively common in spiders. Some merely regurgitate prey for their young, while others go as far as allowing their spiderlings to feast upon their corpse. But maternal care had never been seen in the seemingly \"nasty\" pirate spiders.  \"In the field, we observed females of _Mimetus_, _Anansi_ and _Ero_ taking care of eggs and spiderlings. Pirates can be good mothers,\" says Benavides. \"In some\u00a0instances, females had their eggs distributed evenly in a small web on the underside of a leaf. But if I moved a web or touched the spider, she would gather all the eggs or spiderlings quickly, create a ball with them, and carry them away in\u00a0order to protect them.\"  Pirate spiders are clearly a tale unto themselves. However, their habit of imitating prey in order to devour another spider \u2013 an act known as \"aggressive mimicry\" \u2013 is not unique to them. It has evolved in arachnids independently at least twice before.  There is a genus of jumping spiders known as _Portia_. These spiders also mimic prey, pluck the webs of unlucky host spiders, and devour them.  Like other jumping spiders, _Portia_ spiders have enormous eyes and mostly rely on vision to seek out their prey. In contrast, pirates seem to rely more on their sense of touch. In the lab, covering their eyes with paint does little to hinder their attacks on other spiders.  Pirates and _Portia_ spiders are fairly recent evolutionary developments. However, \"pelican spiders\" also feast on other arachnids \u2013 and they are so ancient, they pre-date the evolution of winged insects.  Pelican spiders owe their nickname to their phenomenally large jaws (technically \"chelicerae\") and elongated necks. Formally known as Archaeidae, they are also sometimes called \"assassin spiders\".  With one chelicera they spear their prey. With the other, they inject the dangling, impaled spider with venom.  Pelican spiders have always preyed on other spiders \u2013 unlike the mimetids, which evolved from web-spinning spiders. They were first discovered from fossilised specimens in 1854, according to Harms, before living specimens were found in Madagascar in 1881.  \"So, if you are older than the radiation of insects, what could you eat? Potentially other spiders,\" says Harms. \"That's why they have such strange morphology.\"  Strange as it may seem, for some spiders feasting on the flesh of their spidery cousins is a great way to make a living.  _Never miss a moment.

This international ranking of university cities has seen Paris slip from first place - a position the French capital has held for four years.  The Canadian city has come top of the QS Best Student Cities, a spin-off from the annual QS World University Rankings.  It will add to suggestions that Canada will attract a bigger slice of the lucrative international student market, particularly if there are concerns about changes to entry rules under President Trump.  It also has the benefit of being able to offer degree courses in two big international languages - with English-speaking universities such as McGill University, and French-speaking, such as the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.  Entry to this league table requires cities to have at least a population of 250,000 and to be home to at least two universities in the World University Rankings.  ## Alternative countries  The rankings are based on a basket of measures - including the quality of universities, facilities for students, affordability, the \"desirability\" of the city for students, access to employers, the international nature of a city, levels of tolerance, pollution and safety.  Image copyright iStock  Canada is seen as high on desirability for international students - with Montreal in top place and Vancouver in 10th and Toronto in 11th place.  Ben Sowter, head of the QS Intelligence Unit which produces the ranking, forecasts that Canada's growing popularity will be part of an increase in \"alternatives to the traditionally dominant study destinations, both in Europe and North America\".  \"Canada will become a major player,\" forecasts Mr Sowter.  Canada could attract students from the US, and the UK could lose students to Ireland, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, he says.  * * *  More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch.  You can join the debate at the BBC's Family &amp; Education News Facebook page.  * * *  A spokeswoman for the city of Montreal says there has already been a surge of international students - with big rises in student numbers from China, India, France and Iran.  ## London still calling  Figures from admissions services in the UK have already shown a 7% fall in applications from EU students - and UK universities have been worried that the backwash of Brexit will leave the UK looking less welcoming to overseas students.  But there are no signs of an adverse impact on London in this year's rankings, moving up from fifth place to third.  Image copyright iStock Image caption London continues to have a strong appeal for students, according to this ranking  The two great world cities of London and Paris are in the top three best places to study - able to offer both a rich cultural as well as academic experience.  Along with Boston, which can claim Harvard, MIT and Boston University, London and Paris are boosted by the strength and number of top universities.  The slip from first to second place for Paris is attributed to cost and a loss in desirability, including safety.  Mr Sowter rejects a link to terror attacks in the French capital - saying that when students are surveyed only a handful of cities are seen as more attractive than Paris.  He says students seem to be resilient to accepting there are no \"zero risk\" cities - whether it is Boston, Berlin or Paris, all of which have maintained their attraction.  ## Seoul appeal  London's universities rate highly on quality - \"no city has a superior variety and quality of universities to London\" - and the falling value of the pound after the EU referendum has improved their affordability for overseas students.  Edinburgh is Scotland's highest ranked university in 18th place.  Apart from Canada, the only other country with two cities in the top 10 is Germany, with Berlin and Munich. This reflects Germany's financial advantages for overseas students - who do not have to pay any tuition fees.  Image caption Montreal and other Canadian universities have been offering an alternative to the US  The most affordable cities of all, taking into account living costs, were Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Surabaya in Indonesia. Stockholm in Sweden and New York in the US were the most expensive.  Asian countries - particularly China and India - provide the biggest cohorts of overseas students. But Asian countries are becoming big magnets in their own right, with five cities in the top 20, headed by Seoul, which has risen to fourth place.  Shanghai is the highest rated city in China in 25th place, with Mumbai the highest in India in 85th place.  The competition for attracting international students is big business.  The US remains the biggest market and annual figures show that for the first time more than a million overseas students were at US universities - with almost 330,000 from China alone.  Apart from the benefits from international research partnerships - and the long-term influence of soft power - such international students are officially estimated at being worth almost $36bn (\u00a329bn) to the US economy.  Being able to attract more of these valuable students makes these rankings much more than a civic beauty contest.  **QS Best Student Cities 2017**  1\\. Montreal  2\\. Paris  3\\. London  4\\.

Thousands of Iraqi soldiers, Kurdish fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, took part in the offensive, which began in October 2016.  ## Final battle  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally declared victory over IS in the city on 10 July.  He waved a national flag with troops after announcing the \"collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood\".  Only hours earlier, clashes were still being reported in a small part of Old City, where a few dozen IS militants were still holding out.  IS forces were pushed back into the Old City, which is a densely built-up area interconnected by small alleyways, after being encircled by pro-Iraqi government forces in the western half of Mosul.  Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled the city, much of which has sustained heavy damage during the eight-month offensive.  ## How the offensive unfolded  The operation was launched on 17 October 2016 with the aim of retaking Mosul and the swathe of territory in northern Iraq captured by IS militants in 2014.  Progress was initially swift, with pro-government forces advancing from the north, south and east, seizing outlying towns and villages despite strong resistance.  Iraqi special forces first entered Mosul on 1 November 2016.  But progress slowed as troops encountered fierce resistance from IS, including snipers, suicide bombers and shellfire.  ![An animation showing damage in the old city of Mosul over time](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/2017/newsspec_17135/mosul_damage_gif.gif)  By January 2017 eastern Mosul was back under Iraqi government control, who announced its full \"liberation\".  But the west of the city presented a more difficult challenge. The densely- packed housing and narrow alleyways enabled a relatively small number of militants to target advancing troops with snipers and suicide bombs.  * * *  ## How territory was regained  Analysis by IHS Conflict Monitor shows how IS fighters lost their territory in the face of the government offensive.  **Situation on 3 July**  Contradictory reports made it difficult to track the progress of the government offensive on the ground.  The maps shown here are based on expert analysis from two different sources, the Institute for the Study of War and IHS Conflict Monitor.  * * *  ## What damage has been caused?  Satellite images show extensive damage to Mosul's infrastructure, buildings and archaeological sites \\- in particular to the airport and bridges.  Imagery released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor in October 2016, showed how IS fighters sabotaged much of the city's airport, with wide trenches carved into it and rubble placed along their lengths.  The barriers were made out of concrete blocks and other rubble, Stratfor's analysis said, possibly from the walls of destroyed buildings.  Imagery also revealed how the jihadists constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the city, including north of the airport.  Meanwhile, coalition air strikes destroyed all bridges linking the east and west of the city across the Tigris river, with the aim of limiting the jihadists' ability to resupply or reinforce their positions in the east.  In the centre of the city, four of the five main bridges were put out of action in October and November by coalition air strikes, with the aim of limiting the jihadists' ability to resupply or reinforce their positions in the east.  The Old Bridge - the only remaining route open to vehicles in the centre of the city - was then disabled in a US-led coalition air strike at the end of December 2016.  Image caption All the city's bridges have been damaged, but Iraqi military engineers installed a floating bridge across the Tigris river in May  Stratfor images showed how the bridges were damaged.  **Al-Hurriya Bridge**  Image copyright AP  A US air strike damaged the al-Hurriya Bridge at the eastern end in October 2016, but IS then set up a barrier on the western side, shown below.  **Fourth Bridge**  In November 2016, a US air strike damaged the Fourth Bridge, but was later rendered impassable by further damage, shown below.  Iraqi military engineers installed a floating bridge across the Tigris river in May, after recapturing eastern Mosul, reconnecting the two halves of the city to facilitate troop deployments ahead of the final assault to dislodge IS.  However, the UN estimates rebuilding the city's basic infrastructure will cost more than $1bn.  Reinstating water, sewage and electricity services, as well as reopening schools and hospitals, would cost more than twice initial estimates, the organisation said.  **Ancient mosque destroyed**  In June 2017, the ancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance after declaring a \"caliphate\", was blown up by IS, according to Iraqi forces.  IS claims the mosque was destroyed in a US air raid.

Image copyright Getty Images  More than 800,000 people have currently fled their homes as a result of fighting in Mosul, according to the International Organisation for Migration.  Most have taken refuge in nearby camps and reception centres. Others have gone to stay with relatives and friends.  Following the recapture of eastern Mosul in January, there was deep concern for thousands of people remaining in the west of the city, with food supplies reported to be very low and clean drinking water in short supply.  The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians. At least 2,463 have been killed and 1,661 injured across Nineveh province since October.  UN human rights officials said in June that they had received credible reports of hundreds of civilians being shot dead by IS militants as they attempted to flee the fighting in western Mosul, with reports of others being used as \"human shields\".  Dozens more have reportedly died in Iraqi and US-led coalition air strikes.  The UN says many of those who have fled Mosul have witnessed the deaths of relatives, friends and neighbours and are suffering from psychological trauma.", "newsHeadline": "How the battle for Mosul unfolded - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37702442", "countriesMentioned": ["Iraq", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "Image copyright Nafiseh Kohnavard Image caption There are thought to be 100,000 people still trapped in the last IS-held district of Mosul  As the battle to retake the last districts of Mosul from IS control enters its final stages, the UN says as many as 100,000 civilians are trapped there, held as human shields by the militants.  BBC Persian's Nafiseh Kohnavard is one of the few international reporters to have been on the frontline and witnessed what's becoming an increasingly desperate humanitarian situation.  Even by the grim standards of the long and bloody battle for Mosul, what's been happening in the western part of the city over the past two weeks is unlike anything that's gone before.  As the Iraqi forces close in on the militants in a tiny area of narrow streets in the old city, the civilian death toll is rising at an alarming rate.  Over the past two weeks, the UN says that 230 residents have been killed in western Mosul, some in air strikes and rocket attacks, and others shot dead by IS snipers as they try to flee.  Unlike in eastern Mosul, where residents were told to stay in their homes and take shelter in the basements while the fighting raged around them, the advice from the Iraqi forces in leaflets dropped on the old town and neighbouring district is stark.  \"If you can find a way out, leave now.\"  Image copyright Nafiseh Kohnavard Image caption This family, like most of the others, had lost a loved one. In this case, a daughter  \"It was a tough decision to make,\" says Gen Fares, from the Iraqi federal police.  \"But these areas are densely packed and we are expected intense fighting so saving civilians lives here is more difficult than in any other area.\"  Standing just back from the frontline in Zanjili district, we watched a steady stream of distraught civilians fleeing towards Iraqi positions.  With IS fighters less than 300 metres away, the air was full of the sound of gunfire and explosions.  Many people were bleeding, many people had become separated from their families or had seen relatives, including children, shot.  All around people were sobbing - adults and children.  And everyone was shouting the same thing: \"IS snipers! They shot at us, they kept shooting at us.\"  Image copyright Nafiseh Kohnavard Image caption Families have been told to flee, but IS snipers target them as they leave  We met a man called Mohammad who seemed frozen with shock.  He was carrying his four-year-old son who had been shot dead as the family fled.  \"We didn't expect this. I swear we didn't,\" he said. \"The army was so close by that we all decided to make a run for it.\"  Even the Iraqi forces seem taken aback by the scale of the chaos.  As we watched we saw medics struggling to deal with the wounded and ambulances too full to take everyone to hospital.  The fleeing residents described an increasingly desperate situation inside the old town as the militants prepare for a fight to the death.  Image copyright Nafiseh Kohnavard Image caption Iraqi federal police admit there are far more IS fighters than first thought  \"They didn't let us come out, they closed down all shops, they took whatever was left in markets and they forced people, especially women and children, to go with them,\" said Zohal a doctor who fled with her husband and four children.  Others spoke of running out of food and water and having to dig wells in their yards to try to find water supplies.  The Iraqi forces say they have no clear idea how many IS militants are holed up in the old town.  \"We thought there were between 150 and 300 IS fighters in western Mosul,\" Lt Gen Jewdat Raed, of the Iraqi Federal Police, told the BBC. \"But after 16 days of day and nights of fighting we have killed 1,800.\"  Image copyright Nafiseh Kohnavard Image caption It was thought there were as few as 150 IS fighters, but police say 1,800 have been killed  The task is complicated by the fact that armoured vehicles and heavy equipment cannot be taken into the narrow alleyways of the old town.  The Iraqi forces are also reluctant to carry out air strikes on major buildings where they suspect the militants are hiding out, because they have reports civilians are being held inside.  Lt Col John Hawbaker, of the US Army 82nd Airborne Division, who is providing advice and assistance to the Iraqi federal police, describes this type of warfare as \"the hardest one for any army in the world\".  As we drove towards the frontline in Zanjili, we passed through areas newly liberated from the militants.

The Iraqi city had been freshly captured by the jihadist group and a \"caliphate\" declared.  At the time, IS controlled a region the size of the United Kingdom - but since then a global war against the jihadists has sent them into retreat, and the whereabouts of Baghdadi - a man with a $25m US bounty on his head - are a mystery.  On the third anniversary of Baghdadi's first - and last public - public appearance, IS no longer controls most of the land it once held. Its leader has been conspicuously silent since addressing followers in a recorded audio message last November, after the battle to dislodge the group from Mosul began.  Amid this silence, unconfirmed reports of Baghdadi's death have recently surfaced. Russia's deputy foreign minister said it was \"highly likely\" Baghdadi was killed in a Russian air force strike on Raqqa on 28 May, and an Iranian official asserted last week that he was \"definitely dead\". However, both claims were questioned by American officials.  In a video released from Raqqa a week after the Russian report surfaced, IS members referred to \"our sheikh\" without mentioning Baghdadi by name, leaving a question mark over his fate. After all, the Taliban and al-Qaeda hid the death of Taliban leader Mullah Omar for two years.  For both his supporters and enemies, Baghdadi's absence at such a critical moment is perplexing.  ## 'Third capital'  The answer to the question about Baghdadi's whereabouts might be related to his claim to legitimacy as caliph, or \"commander of the faithful\".  According to a contentious religious rule, a candidate can (among other criteria) claim the title if he has \"ardh tamkeen\", or \"land to rule\".  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p056n8fw.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionBlast in Iraq destroys Great Mosque of al-Nuri  Today, the ardh tamkeen is shrinking. IS is all but a spent force in Mosul and is under immense pressure in Raqqa, its two de facto capitals in Iraq and Syria.  (In recognition of the defining moment in Iraq, IS blew up the al-Nuri mosque two weeks ago before security forces could seize the site).  Baghdadi might be in hiding in what could be described as IS's \"third capital\", namely the areas currently controlled by the group on the two sides of the Syrian and Iraqi borders.  IS calls this area Wilayat al-Furat, or \"Euphrates Province\", which mainly comprises the Iraqi town of al-Qaim and the Syrian town of Albu Kamal.  In 2014, the rise of IS began in Wilayat al-Furat and surrounding areas. According to the group's own accounts, in videos produced recently from Anbar province in Iraq, the militants used the region as a launchpad for its blitzkriegs in Iraq and Syria.  Image copyright Russia Defence Ministry Image caption Russia says Baghdadi might have been killed in an air strike on this building (right-hand image)  The region also has relatively weakly armed militias and tribes, which could hold and secure the region if and when it is recaptured.  Even in supposedly liberated areas like Rutba, a town to the south, IS has still managed to carry out frequent deadly hit-and-run attacks.  ## Desert hideouts  No campaign has been launched yet to liberate these remote towns. Discussions as to whether the US or the Syrian government and its allies should lead the offensive on the Syrian side of the border are still being held in Washington.  If the US conducts the campaign, questions remain as to whether rebel fighters or the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) should lead the fight.  In Iraq, places like Tal Afar, west of Mosul, appear to be a current priority for the pro-government forces.  ##  Interactive See how the area IS controls has changed since 2016  ###  June 2017  ![Areas under IS control, Iraq and Syria June 2017](https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/image-slider- Iraq_syria_slider2/iraq_syria_control_jan2016_june2017_624_qtq68.png)  ###  January 2016  ![Areas under IS control, Iraq and Syria Jan 2016](https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/image-slider- Iraq_syria_slider2/iraq_syria_control_jan2016_jan2016_624_9og1d.png)  Hisham al-Hashimi, an adviser to the Iraqi government and an expert on Iraqi jihadist groups, suggests that Wilayat al-Furat is where al-Baghdadi is likely to be hiding.  The Iraqi government has carried out several air strikes in Albu Kamal over the past two years. Iyad al-Jamili, one of al-Baghdadi's closest aides has been spotted in the Syrian town, according to Mr Hashimi.  A number of other close associates of the IS leader have also been seen in Albu Kamal and Mayadin, another key IS town in the Syrian province of Deir al- Zour, Mr Hashimi says.  Wilayat al-Furat is the only remaining region where IS can claim ardh tamkeen.  The campaign to clear the region might take many months to begin and much longer to conclude.  Even after these areas are liberated, IS is likely to use the desert, river valleys and border zones as hideouts and to launch attacks on urban centres.  ## Most wanted  Baghdadi, unlike other jihadist leaders, tends to speak or appear only when there is an extreme need for it - as seen with the announcement of the caliphate and the appeal to followers to stand and fight in Mosul.  The higher up the IS chain of command, the more communication with superiors becomes restricted to a small number of trusted loyalists.  Less than a handful people would therefore know Baghdadi's whereabouts. That makes it hard for the US, which has dedicated special forces constantly on the look-out for any traces of the world's most wanted man.  The borderlands of Syria and Iraq provide Baghdadi with relatively secure and familiar terrain, in which he can hide and circumvent attempts to capture or kill him.  They also provide him with the ability to continue to claim legitimacy as commander of the faithful.  _Hassan Hassan is a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, Washington, and co-author of ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror.

More than two years later, Iraqi security forces have launched a major offensive to retake it with the support of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Shia paramilitary forces, Sunni tribesmen and US-led coalition air strikes.  Before it fell to IS, the oil-rich capital of Nineveh province was the political, economic and cultural centre of north-western Iraq.  Its 1.8 million population was one of Iraq's most diverse, comprising ethnic Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians and Turkmens, as well as many religious minorities.  Image copyright Hulton Archive / Keystone Features Image caption Mosul's Great Mosque, built in the 12th Century, is famous for its leaning minaret  Mosul - meaning \"the link\" in Arabic - was established on the western bank of the River Tigris in the 6th Century, just across the water from the ancient Assyrian site of Nineveh, whose ruins it eventually encircled.  By the time of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th Century, Mosul had become the principal city of northern Mesopotamia and a major trading centre. Its most famous export was a fine cotton fabric that European merchants called \"muslin\", derived from the city's name.  In 1262, Mosul was sacked by the Mongols under Hulagu, a grandson of Genghis Khan, after an almost year-long siege during which its inhabitants suffered greatly.  In the 16th Century, Mosul fell to the Ottoman Turks. Under their rule, the city once again thrived and became an administrative and commercial hub.  Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War One, Mosul and its surrounding province were occupied by British forces. In 1926, they became part of mandatory Iraq as a result of a border settlement with the new Turkish state.  At the same time, Mosul benefited considerably from the development of oilfields in the region. It also became a centre of cement, textile and sugar production.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Successive governments pursued a policy of Arabization in Mosul, displacing the city's Kurds  After Iraq gained independence in 1932, successive governments attempted to \"Arabize\" Mosul and other areas of northern Iraq, by forcibly displacing hundreds of thousands of ethnic Kurds, Turkmens and Assyrians, and encouraging landless Arabs from central and southern Iraq to resettle there.  The policy was stepped up by Saddam Hussein's Baath Party in the 1970s and continued until the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, after which many Kurds and other non-Arabs sought to reclaim property that they said had been expropriated by the government, increasing ethnic tensions.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mosul fell to US and Kurdish forces in April 2003  Kurdish Peshmerga fighters also took control of several nearby towns and villages, seeking to incorporate them into the autonomous Kurdistan Region, and a Sunni Arab boycott of the 2005 provincial elections led to Kurdish parties governing Nineveh for four years.  The Kurdish gains helped turned Mosul into a bastion of resistance to the US occupation, resulting in years of bombings and shooting by militants from al- Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) - a precursor to IS - and former Baath Party loyalists who portrayed themselves as defenders of Arab interests.  In 2007, many AQI members relocated to Mosul after US and Iraqi troops and Sunni Arab tribesmen launched operations to drive them from provinces to the south and west. Mosul's proximity to Syria also meant that it was a conduit for foreign fighters.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Mosul became a bastion of resistance to the US occupation  It was not until 2009 that a semblance of normality returned to Mosul, but jihadists maintained a firm hold and it was still one of Iraq's most dangerous cities.  Sectarian violence increased once again after US troops withdrew from Iraq in late 2011, and surged in early 2013 when Shia Arab Prime Minister Nouri Maliki ordered an offensive against AQI while also moving against Sunni Arab protesters, who were angered by his government's sectarian policies.  Image copyright AP Image caption Many Sunni Arabs in Mosul initially welcomed the arrival of Islamic State militants  In June 2014, emboldened by their capture of the western Iraqi city of Falluja six months earlier and subsequent battlefield successes in Syria's civil war, militants from what was then known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) launched an assault on Mosul. Between 10,000 and 30,000 soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled when confronted by as few as 800 militants.  The militants then swept southwards, taking control of much of Nineveh and two neighbouring provinces in a matter of days. Half a million people fled their homes to escape the onslaught.  Days later, Isis declared the establishment of a \"caliphate\" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth - and changed its name to \"Islamic State\".  Image copyright AP Image caption Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi enjoined Muslims to emigrate to IS territory at Mosul's Great Mosque  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi then made his first public appearance in many years, delivering a sermon at Mosul's Great Mosque in which he enjoined Muslims to emigrate to IS territory.  Initially, many Sunni Arab residents of Mosul appeared to welcome the militants.  But opposition grew as they experienced more than two years of brutal IS rule, during which there were public beheadings and amputations, smoking was banned and women were forced to cover themselves in public. People also complained of IS surveillance and extortion, as well as shortages of water, electricity and fuel.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p048mgz6.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionMosul diary: 'I feel like I'm living in a prison'  There was also outrage when IS began destroying Mosul's cultural heritage, when videos emerged showing renowned Muslim and Christian sites being razed to the ground, antiquities inside the Mosul Museum smashed up, and colossal statues on Nineveh's ancient Nergal Gate demolished.  By the time that Iraqi government forces were ready to launch an offensive to retake Mosul in October 2016, some of the one million people estimated to be still living in the city had begun openly resisting IS rule.  Two men were beheaded after a number of walls in the city were spray-painted with the letter \"m\", standing for \"resistance\" in Arabic, and more than 50 people were also reportedly summarily killed for their role in a rebellion plot.  The estimated 3,000 to 5,000 militants left in Mosul have prepared to defend the city by digging tunnels, rigging bridges with explosives, preparing car bombs and recruiting children as spies, Iraqi and US officials said.  * * *  **Are you in the region around Mosul?

Elsewhere in Iraq, though, the jihadist group still controls a number of towns.  ## Tal Afar  IS designates Tal Afar as part of its self-titled \"Jazeera Province\", which encompasses areas to the west of Mosul, near the Syrian border.  Tal Afar was a hub for Sunni Muslim militancy long before the group's arrival. Its Shia population, including a large number of ethnic Turkmen, suffered attacks that gave rise to inter-communal tensions and provided ripe conditions for an effortless IS takeover in 2014.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shia-dominated paramilitary forces have surrounded Tal Afar and are awaiting order to advance  In addition, Tal Afar's strategic location near the Syrian border was ideal for the movement of IS militants and weapons, and this soon led to it becoming one of the group's headquarters in Iraq.  For months now the town has been surrounded by the Shia-dominated paramilitary Popular Mobilisation forces, who are awaiting orders to advance.  * * *  ## Al-Qaim, Rawa and Ana  In the western province of Anbar, IS still fully controls three towns - al- Qaim, Rawa and Ana.  Along with the town of Albu Kamal in eastern Syria, these areas make up IS's self-styled, cross-border \"Euphrates Province\".  The name derives from the River Euphrates, which flows through the two countries.  Image copyright N/A Image caption IS publicised the destruction of berms along the Iraq-Syria border in 2014  The province has great strategic importance to IS as the group uses routes through it to transfer fighters, weapons and goods between Iraq and Syria.  It is also a symbol of the jihadists' intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay to rest the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement - something many Arabs resent.  Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has vowed to retake Rawa, Ana and al-Qaim in the next phase of military operations against IS.  * * *  ## Hawija  IS captured the district of Hawija, south-west of oil-rich city of Kirkuk, in June 2014.  The large district includes the towns of Hawija, Riyad, Rashad, Zab and Abbasi - all of which IS still holds and considers part of \"Kirkuk Province\".  The jihadist group has also laid siege to an estimated 150,000 civilians in the area, many of whom suffer from shortages of food and medicine.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The jihadist' capture of many towns in the Hawija district prompted many residents to flee  Hawija came under the spotlight in April 2014, when Iraqi forces raided an anti-government protest camp by Sunnis in the town and clashed with protesters, reportedly leaving 20 people dead.  The heightened anti-government sentiment in the aftermath of that incident made the town vulnerable to an IS takeover.  The presence of IS in Hawija has been widely blamed for ongoing jihadist attacks in the wider Kirkuk region, as well as in neighbouring Salahuddin and further afield in Diyala.  The group's media has continued to publish propaganda from Hawija, showing \"normal\" daily life there as well as the summary killings of alleged informants.  The Iraqi government was expected to recapture the town from IS before heading to Mosul in October 2016, and was criticised by local officials for failing to do so.", "newsHeadline": "After Mosul: The Iraqi towns still under IS control - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40368026", "countriesMentioned": ["Iraq"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![A man carries two young children as they flee fighting in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq \\(2 July 2017\\)](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7F09/production/_96812523_mediaitem96812519.jpg) Image copyright AFP  The fog of war once again begins to sweep over Mosul General Hospital, with an announcement that crackles out of the loudspeakers.

Her aunt whispers to me that her name is Sakina. She is bleeding, so I call out to my colleagues for help.  I am not a medical worker and am already beginning to wonder: Is this serious? Will she survive?  I do not have to wait long to find out. Sakina has several wounds from an explosion.  My colleagues rush in to try to save her.

Air strikes, sniper fire, shelling and roadside bombs mean no place in the Old City is safe.  Residents are being forced to make impossible life-or-death choices as they seek to flee the violence.  Explosions shake the hospital, which lies only 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the frontline.  The staff say they do not feel in danger, but the workload is heavy. In early June they had three days in a row when 80 to 90 patients arrived all at once.

Bomb blasts throw small stones deep into young bodies, a sickening kind of shrapnel that explodes up in anger from the very streets where these children used to run and play.  There is no child's play now. There are no fairy tales here. Mosul's young have been plunged violently into a real-life horror story that seemingly has no happy ending.  Parents are sucked into this horror story too - one with many chapters.  There is the father who carried his two-year-old into the hospital, suffering from a large gunshot wound to the head. And another who calmly asked a medical colleague for 22 body bags, because all of his family had been wiped out. A surgeon helped him with his request, but only after going behind a wall to cry.

Some receive incentives. Many do not, but they are still here helping. It is incredible.  I make a decision. I am here to take pictures, but I ask myself: \"What am I doing behind my camera? I took some first aid courses so I am sure I can help, if only a little?\"  Doctors begin giving me tasks: \"Take the bandage.\" \"Put pressure on the wound.\" \"Quickly, over here.\"  I see another child who is wailing. I try to speak to her to calm her. She says: \"I don't want to live without my mom. I wish I was the one who stepped on the mine.\"  Her face is full of shrapnel. It is the first time I have seen someone bleed from the eyes. She asks: \"Am I blind?\" She keeps screaming. She is terrifying everyone.  I am from Lebanon and I have seen lots of war. I am not afraid of shelling and shooting. But today I can see that our basic humanity is under attack.  I appeal to all sides in this conflict to protect civilians. Protect them all as if they were your own loved ones. Let them escape. Give them food, water and shelter. Respect the laws of war for the sake of all of us.

After she died, her aunt left the room and I followed. We cried together. I was hugging a total stranger but it felt like I was hugging my own aunt. She told me Sakina's mother and siblings had already been killed.  I now come face to face with Sakina's father, who has arrived at the hospital. He is calm, silent, but clearly deeply traumatised.  There is an Arabic saying: \"There are a million words behind the silence.\" This is all too true as we look at each other, saying nothing.  Of the 45 patients who arrived at the hospital today, four died.  I take my camera, my pictures and my memories away with me at the end of a hot and horrendous day.  The work will go on.

But Labour's Angela Rayner said the results had been achieved despite \"constant chopping and changing to exams, school structures and the curriculum\".  Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said that staff shortages of specialist teachers in maths and science was keeping England out of the \"premier division\" of international education.  Northern Ireland has performed very strongly at primary maths, maintaining the same position as four years ago, and is the first in the following group behind the top Asian countries.

In three sentences**  The Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) provides education rankings based on international tests taken by 15-year-olds in maths, reading and science.  The tests, run by the OECD and taken every three years, have become increasingly influential on politicians who see their countries and their policies being measured against these global school league tables.  Asian countries continue to dominate, with Singapore rated as best, replacing Shanghai, which is now part of a combined entry for China.  * * *  Singapore has replaced Shanghai as the previous top-ranked education system - with Shanghai no longer appearing as a separate entry in these school rankings.  There had been debate over whether Shanghai was representative of school standards across China - and this year, for the first time, Shanghai is included in a wider figure for China, based on schools in four provinces.  This combined Chinese ranking is in the top 10 for maths and science, but does not make the top 20 for reading.  Hong Kong and Macao also appear among the high-achieving education systems.  The US has again failed to make progress.  \"We're losing ground - a troubling prospect when, in today's knowledge-based economy, the best jobs can go anywhere in the world,'' said the US Education Secretary, John King.  ## Asian countries on top  Asian education systems dominate the upper reaches of the these results tables - accounting for the top seven places for maths, with Singapore followed by Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Japan, China and South Korea.  Image copyright PA Image caption The UK's test results remain behind the top- performing Asian education systems  Finland, Estonia, Canada and Ireland are the only non-Asian nations to get into any of the top five rankings across all three subjects.  Mr Schleicher said that Asian countries such as Singapore managed to achieve excellence without wide differences between children from wealthy and disadvantaged families.  He described Vietnam's progress as \"quite remarkable\", coming ahead of Germany and Switzerland in science - and ahead of the US in science and maths.  Image caption Andreas Schleicher says Singapore has high results without a big gap between rich and poor  Among South American countries, Mr Schleicher highlighted the improvements in Peru and Colombia.

Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: \"We can all agree we are not yet where we want to be.\"  But she said that \"hard work is underway\" to make improvements in Wales - and that it was important to \"stay the course\".  Scotland trails behind England and Northern Ireland - recording its worst results in these Pisa rankings.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the \"results underline the case for radical reform of Scotland's education system\".  England had the strongest results in the UK, but compared with previous years, Mr Schleicher said \"performance hasn't moved at all\".  The OECD education chief highlighted concerns about the impact of teacher shortages - saying that an education system could never exceed the quality of its teachers.  \"There is clearly a perceived shortage,\" he said, warning that head teachers saw a teacher shortage as \"a major bottleneck\" to raising standards.  * * *  **So why is Singapore so successful at education?**  Singapore only became an independent country in 1965.  And while in the UK the Beatles were singing We Can Work It Out, in Singapore they were really having to work it out, as this new nation had a poor, unskilled, mostly illiterate workforce.

And from being among the world's poorest, with a mix of ethnicities, religions and languages, Singapore has overtaken the wealthiest countries in Europe, North America and Asia to become the number one in education.  Prof Sing Kong Lee, vice-president of Nanyang Technological University, which houses Singapore's National Institute of Education, said a key factor had been the standard of teaching.  \"Singapore invested heavily in a quality teaching force - to raise up the prestige and status of teaching and to attract the best graduates,\" said Prof Lee.  The country recruits its teachers from the top 5% of graduates in a system that is highly centralised.  All teachers are trained at the National Institute of Education, and Prof Lee said this single route ensured quality control and that all new teachers could \"confidently go through to the classroom\".  This had to be a consistent, long-term approach, sustained over decades, said Prof Lee.

Speaking at an international education conference, Grylls says he lacked confidence as a youngster and describes his own approach to tackling fear and those nagging self-doubts.  \"I've learned that the best way over our fears is right bang through the middle. It really is. The only way you don't see the fear is when you're right on it.  \"I've learned this the hard way. It's how I deal with it now,\" he said at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai.  Image caption Climbing Everest became a focus for the adventurer's recovery from back injuries  He says he is also \"really nervous\" of jumping out of aeroplanes, which is understandable since in his 20s he broke his back in three places in a parachuting accident in Africa.  His recovery from this injury became the springboard for his later ambitions - setting the target of climbing Everest and giving him the fire in his belly to make the most of this \"second chance\" in life.  \"It was definitely a dark time after that accident.  \"My over-riding emotion was that I really have got lucky. I should either be dead or paralysed. There's got to be some purpose behind this. Life has given me a second chance.  \"I might be a bit crook and a bit scarred, but I'm OK and I'm really going to claw my way back - and I really want to do something with my life.  \"Sometimes in life it takes a knock to remember what we really value.\"  Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning  There probably isn't a pamphlet in the careers office for people wanting to become adventurers.  But Grylls has a straightforward explanation for the path he took - and the occupational hazard of constantly putting himself in danger.  \"It's the only thing I'm good at. I'm not saying that out of modesty, it really is. It's my job, it's what I really love. It's what over the years I've become half-decent at.\"  And he says the parachute accident was another spur to improve and get things right in split-second decisions.  When his parachute was failing to function properly and he was spinning to the ground, he says he wasn't thinking about his life flashing before his eyes - instead he was trying to sort out the parachute.  * * *  More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch.

Now I really take pride that I'm good in those moments. But these are skills we develop.\"  Image caption \"Sometimes in life it takes a knock to remember what we really value\"  He is famous for his survival skills. But he says the first inhospitable terrain he had to conquer was his own lack of self-confidence.  \"I wasn't very good at school - and I struggled a lot with confidence,\" says the Eton-educated adventurer.  But he says such early struggles can be better preparation than success coming too easily.  \"The great people I know in life often struggled at school, because it was the struggle that developed their strength.\"  His descriptions are also punctuated by an awareness of the small margins between success and failure - and life and death.  When he talks about the last exhausting phase of climbing Everest, he describes coming across the body of another climber he had known, Rob Hall, who had died on the mountain two years before.  \"I remember just sitting next to Rob, still perfectly there, his hair blowing, as if I could nudge him and he'd stand up and be fine.  \"I desperately needed something to give me strength - and he is such a hero of mine. I just remember this panic filling me - there are a lot of bodies on the mountain, but this was different - we were so close, but now so far away.\"  He pushed on and became one of the youngest climbers to get to the summit of Everest.  And he says he brought back some snow from the summit and kept it as a liquid symbol of conquering his self-doubt.

It's in contrast to the worries about young people spending too long in front of screens, missing out on exercise and stressing over social media.  He says young people need to see the outdoor world and to experience risk in their lives to build a spirit of adventure and curiosity.  \"If you strip risk out of young people's lives, you kill that spirit. Risk is all around us - and you empower kids if you teach them how to manage that risk.\"  And he says it's the shy and under-confident youngsters he wants to encourage most.  \"The rewards in life don't always go to the biggest or the bravest, the cleverest, or even the best,\" he tells them.  \"The rewards in life go to the dogged and the determined, to the tenacious, those who get back on their feet when they get kicked.\"  He's prepared for numbingly cold temperatures and the threats of hungry predators.

And the classic BBC comedy series Fawlty Towers is being deployed by some teachers in an attempt to give Japanese students an example of spoken English - rather than focusing on written language and grammar.  Japan's government and businesses want to use the Olympics to boost tourism and global trade and to present a positive image of Japan to the world.  So the government needs to ensure a supply of English speakers to be Olympic volunteers and work in the accommodation, tourism, and retail industries.  There is also a demand for professionals, such as doctors and nurses, to speak to visitors or competitors in English.  Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The Olympics in Tokyo will require many more English speakers to help visitors  Japan's government has been working to bridge this English language gap.  The subject is now taught in school from when students are eight or nine years old and remains compulsory for the next seven years.  University students and school teachers have been sent on trips abroad to learn English, and many universities are giving language lessons to prospective Olympic volunteers.  There are even proposals to create an \"English village\" in Tokyo, populated entirely by English-speakers, where learners could immerse themselves in the language.  But early indications are that progress has been slow, and the country still comes surprisingly far down global rankings of English proficiency.  * * *  More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch.

So why is learning English so difficult for the Japanese?  Megumi Tada, an education expert at Hirosaki University, said the main reason is \"the lack of teachers who can effectively use the language\".  When the Kyoto Board of Education asked middle school English teachers to take the TOEIC, fewer than one in four teachers reached the threshold for language skills good enough for most social demands and limited work requirements.  Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Japan has been investing in improving its language skills at school and for adults  Ms Tada said that although the government has now introduced English in primary schools, most of the teachers in these schools are not qualified to teach the language.  She said a better way to improve English teaching would be to increase the number of trained teachers in primary and secondary schools, and to train them for longer.  There are also questions about the way English is taught in schools. The focus tends to be on grammar, vocabulary and writing, which are repeatedly tested in high-pressure exams.  As a result, English is rarely spoken in Japanese classrooms.  Junnosuke Nakamura, who leads the education company EF in Japan, has said that \"too often in our schools, a Japanese national is teaching English in Japanese, and English must be taught in English\".  He said the government's reforms \"have not actually changed anything at a fundamental level\".  Image caption Helen Bentley says learners in Japan are more confident writing rather than speaking English  Helen Bentley, from communications firm Finsbury, worked on Tokyo's Olympic bid.  \"There are relatively few opportunities to use spoken English in Japan,\" she said.  \"As a result, many Japanese are much stronger at reading and writing than they are at speaking.\"  There are teachers trying a more imaginative approach to getting students to speak English - such as setting them comedies to watch for homework.  Teachers in Fukuoka Prefecture have been using Fawlty Towers and Red Dwarf to get students used to hearing spoken English.  It raises the prospect of a generation of Japanese students sounding like Basil, Sybil or even Manuel.  Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Is the culture of perfectionism in Japan a barrier to learning languages  There is also a barrier from a culture of perfectionism in Japanese education, with a belief that there is a \"right\" way to do something.  Students do not want to make mistakes and they will not attempt something until they are sure they can get it right.  This might be a good thing for literacy and numeracy - Japan comes consistently near the top of global rankings such as PISA.  But it does not work so well for languages, for which speaking and making mistakes are crucial to learning.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Language learners have to be ready to make mistakes  Fumiko Inoue, who lectures in Japanese language and cross-cultural management at Rotterdam Business School, pointed to the experience of one of her Dutch students who taught English in a school in Tokyo.  At first, the new teacher was surprised that students were reluctant to speak English in class, but after a lot of encouragement she got them to chat to each other in the language.  That is, until she was observed by a senior teacher who criticised her students for making too many grammatical mistakes.  \"If you don't say anything, you don't make any mistakes either, of course,\" said Prof Inoue.  This teaching style can have lifelong effects on how Japanese people approach the English language.  \"We Japanese have a strong psychological barrier to speaking English,\" said Kumiko Iwasaki, a professor of psychology and education at the Open University of Japan.  \"We have an obsession that we have to speak English perfectly.\"", "newsHeadline": "Japan turns to Basil Fawlty in race for Olympic English - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39410915", "countriesMentioned": ["Japan", "Spain"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Migrants seek advice on immigration status](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16C90/production/_95582339_038688485.jpg) Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There have been fears about deportation among migrant families in the US  Sitting in a lecture hall at the University of California, Los Angeles, Maria Marquez found her mind was wandering.

Her family moved from Guadalajara, Mexico to California without papers when she was just three years old and have lived there ever since.  Hundreds of thousands of students are in a similar position.

The subject of undocumented students' status has electrified US college campuses since the election.  As students ramp up campaigns for immigrants' rights, university leaders are appointing full-time immigration lawyers and counsellors to support them, running \"know your rights\" classes and even lobbying the government on their behalf.  Ms Marquez is in a legal grey area. She is one of about 750,000 young people recognised under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme, an Obama-era measure that offers two-year protection from deportation, as well as work permits, to some undocumented immigrants who moved to the US as children.  Image caption Yale student Larissa Martinez is worried about her future status in the US  President Trump's campaign website said he would \"immediately terminate\" the DACA programme. He has so far left it in place, but many students worry that its days might be numbered.  And many students without DACA are more worried than before about deportation, because the administration has toughened guidance on enforcement to expand the list of prioritised \"removable aliens\".  However, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said that the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency was focusing on \"convicted criminals who pose a threat to public safety as well as recent border crosses\".  Amid this uncertainty, universities are offering extra support for undocumented students.

He says that Mr Corral has been kept \"very busy\".  The university has attempted to reassure students by saying it will not share their information with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement without a court order.  Others, including New York University and Columbia University, have given similar reassurances.

She is an undocumented student who is not eligible for DACA status, because her family moved to the US in 2010, and the programme requires applicants to have lived in the US since 2007.  \"There's an everyday struggle of wondering whether the worries of school are as important as they are to all of my peers,\" she says. \"I care about school, and I understand its importance, but sometimes it's hard to reconcile that with real life problems.  \"Like, sometimes I wonder, what if every day I try my hardest and three and a half years into this [degree] I get deported?

The proposal to change the fusty lyrics of a 19th Century song, \"Fair Harvard\", has started a very contemporary argument about identity and how universities represent their own past.  Harvard's \"presidential task force on inclusion and belonging\" has announced a competition to find a replacement for the song's ending, which praises the university's puritan heritage: \"Be the herald of Light, and the bearer of Love, Till the stock of the Puritans die.\"  They want this symbol of Harvard's identity, sung at university ceremonies, to refer to something broader and more inclusive than the starchy New England colonialists.  But according to the Harvard Crimson university newspaper, the decision to ditch the reference to puritan founders seems to have had a lukewarm response among students.  ## 'Editing history'  There were questions raised about the relevance of changing a song from the 1830s that has never really been a source of contention.  On Twitter, there were complaints about \"editing history\" and censorship.  Academic and social commentator Frank Furedi described it as \"morally disoriented\".

But Professor Danielle Allen, co-chair of the university's inclusion task force, said in a statement that the symbols and mottos had to be appropriate for everyone \"regardless of background, identity, religious affiliation or viewpoint\".  She said the current university song lyrics suggested that \"the commitment to truth, and to being the bearer of its light, is the special province of those of puritan stock.

And as well as looking for different words, the university is considering an alternative tune or style for the song, with the suggestion of a hip-hop version.  ## 'Safe spaces'  This is the latest university battle over emblems and language, with arguments over how institutions should balance their historic roots with the need to appeal to a modern, diverse range of students.  These come alongside strongly-contested debates about \"safe spaces\" and \"no- platforming\", with arguments over whether students have a right to block views they find offensive.

After a long-running protest, Yale University announced earlier this year that it would re-name Calhoun College, named after a 19th Century advocate of slavery.  It is now to be named after a female computer scientist, Grace Murray Hopper.  Harvard is dropping the title of \"house master\" because of connotations of slavery, and ending the use of a seal that includes the family crest of a notoriously brutal slave trader.  The university was once an owner of slaves and has held a series of events and commemorations to examine its own connections to the slave trade.

Students at the University of Bristol have called for the re-naming of a building because of claims of historic links with wealth derived from slavery.  Oxford University's Oriel College had a high-profile controversy over whether a statue of the Cecil Rhodes should be removed, with protestors arguing that the Victorian magnate's views on race made him an unsuitable figure to be commemorated.  But the call for the statue's removal was rejected.  Oxford University last month announced that it was putting up more than 20 portraits to ensure more images of women and people from ethnic minorities were represented on its walls.

But this is an illusion, born of our limited perspective.  Our planet rotates on its axis once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds. It also orbits the Sun, while our Solar System dashes around the centre of the Milky Way, which is itself hurtling across the Universe towards a region of space called the Great Attractor. The speeds involved are frankly dizzying.  Even if you ignore all that, the Earth is far from stable. Beneath us, enormous chunks of rock are constantly grinding past each other to make valleys, pushing together to form mountains, or dragging apart to create rivers and oceans. The ground under us is forever shifting, stretching and wobbling.  Most of the time, this is nothing to worry about. However, our growing understanding of these phenomena is driving a better understanding of the inner workings of our planet. It is also handy for anyone trying to track and land spacecraft. Here, then, are seven things that make the Earth move for us.  **Under pressure**\u00a0  A desktop globe is a perfect sphere, so it spins smoothly around a fixed axis. However, the Earth is not spherical, and the mass within it is both unevenly distributed and prone to moving around. As a result, the axis around which Earth spins, and the north and south rotational poles at each end of the axis, move about.  What's more, because the rotation axis is different to the figure axis around which its mass is balanced, the Earth wobbles as it spins.  > The cause is now widely accepted to be the combination of changes in atmospheric and oceanic pressures  This wobble was predicted by scientists as far back as Isaac Newton. To be more precise, it is made up of a number of distinct wobbles.  The one that has the greatest impact is known as the Chandler Wobble, first observed by American astronomer Seth Chandler Jr in 1891. It causes movements of the poles of around 26ft (9m) and takes some 14 months to complete a full cycle.  During the 20th Century scientists suggested a wide variety of causes, including changes in continental water storage, atmospheric pressure, earthquakes, and interactions at the boundary of the Earth's core and mantle.  Geophysicist Richard Gross of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California solved the mystery in 2000. He applied new weather and oceanic models to observations on the Chandler Wobble from 1985-1995. Gross calculated that two-thirds of the Wobble was caused by fluctuating seabed pressure, and one-third by changes in atmospheric pressure.  \"Their relative importance varies with time,\" says Gross, \"but the cause is now widely accepted to be the combination of changes in atmospheric and oceanic pressures.\"  **Water works**  The seasons are the second largest influence on the Earth's wobble. That is because they cause geographical variations in the amount of rain, snow and humidity.  Scientists have been able to pinpoint the poles using the relative positions of the stars since 1899, and using satellites since the 1970s. But even after removing the impact of the Chandler and seasonal wobbles, the north and south rotational poles still move about with respect to the Earth's crust.  > Researchers were puzzled because the spin axis shifted every six to 14 years  In a study published in April 2016, Surendra Adhikari and Erik Ivins, also at JPL, identified two more important pieces of the Earth wobble jigsaw.  Before the year 2000, the Earth's spin axis was drifting towards Canada, a few inches per year. But then measurements show the spin axis changed tack, heading instead towards the British Isles. Some scientists suggested this could be the result of the loss of ice caused by the rapid melting of Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheets.  Adhikari and Ivins set out to test this idea. They compared GPS measurements of the positions of the poles with data from GRACE, a study that uses satellites to measure changes in mass around the Earth.  They found that the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets only explains around two-thirds of the recent shift in the direction of the poles. The remainder, they concluded, is down to the loss of water held on continents, mostly the Eurasian land mass.  This region has been affected by aquifer depletion and drought. However, at first the amount of water involved seemed too small to have such an impact.  > Before the year 2000, the Earth's spin axis was drifting towards Canada  Then they factored in the position of the areas affected. \"From the fundamental physics of rotating objects, we know that movement of the poles is highly sensitive to changes at [around] +/- 45 degree latitudes,\" says Adhikari. That is exactly where Eurasia had lost water.  The study also identified continental water storage as a plausible explanation for another wobble in the Earth's rotation.  Throughout the 20th Century, researchers were puzzled because the spin axis shifted every six to 14 years, heading 0.5-1.5m east or west of its overall drift. Adhikari and Ivins found that, between 2002 and 2015, dry years in Eurasia corresponded to the eastward swings and wet years corresponded to westward movements.  \"We found a perfect match,\" says Adhikari. \"It's the first time anyone successfully identified a one-to-one match between the global-scale inter- annual wet-dry variability and inter-annual polar motion.\"  **Man-made meandering**  While these movements of water and ice are caused by a combination of natural processes and human actions, other changes that impact the Earth's wobbling are all our own doing.  In a 2009 study Felix Landerer, also of the JPL, calculated that, if carbon dioxide levels double between 2000 and 2100, the oceans will warm and expand in such a way that the north pole will shift around 1.5cm per year towards Alaska and Hawai'i over the next century.  Similarly, in a 2007 study Landerer modelled the effects of the ocean warming caused by the same carbon dioxide increase on ocean bottom pressures and circulation. He found that the changes would shift mass to higher latitudes, and that this would shorten the day by a little over 0.1 milliseconds: 1/10,000th of a second.  **Quake shake**  It is not just large volumes of water and ice that affect the Earth's rotation if they move around. Shifting rocks have the same effect, if they are big enough.  Earthquakes occur when the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's surface slip past each other suddenly. In theory, that could make a difference.  > The magnitude-9.1 earthquake that hit Japan in 2011 shortened the length of the day by 1.8 microseconds  For example, Gross studied the massive 8.8-magnitude quake that hit the coast of Chile in 2010. In as as-yet-unpublished study, he calculated that the plate movements shifted Earth's axis of mass balance by around 8cm.  However, this was only a model-based estimate. Gross and others have since attempted to observe real shifts in the way the Earth is spinning, by following earthquakes in GPS satellite data.  So far this has proved unsuccessful, because it is tricky to remove all the other things that influence how the Earth rotates. \"The models are not perfect and there is residual noise masking the smaller earthquake signals,\" says Gross.  The movements of mass that take place when tectonic plates slip past each other also affect the length of days. This is a little bit like an ice skater spinning on one spot: she can speed up by drawing her arms in and thus shifting her mass closer to her body, or slow down by doing the opposite. For example, Gross calculated that the magnitude-9.1 earthquake that hit Japan in 2011 shortened the length of the day by 1.8 microseconds.  **Storm force wobble**  When an earthquake happens, it triggers seismic waves that carry its energy through the interior of the Earth.  > They traced the waves' origins to a severe North Atlantic storm called a \"weather bomb\"  There are two kinds. \"P-waves\" repeatedly squeeze and expand the material they pass through, with the vibrations travelling in the same direction as the wave. Slower \"S-waves\" wobble rock from side to side, with the vibrations occurring at right angles to their direction of travel.  Intense storms can also create faint seismic waves like those triggered by earthquakes. These waves are called microseisms. Until recently, scientists have been unable to determine the sources of S-waves from microseisms.  In a study published in August 2016, Kiwamu Nishida of the University of Tokyo and Ryota Takagi of Tohoku University reported that they had used a network of 202 detectors in southern Japan to track both P- and S-waves. They traced the waves' origins to a severe North Atlantic storm called a \"weather bomb\": a storm in which the atmospheric pressure at the centre drops unusually rapidly.  Tracking microseisms in this way will help researchers to better understand the internal structure of the Earth.  **Lunar influence**  It is not just Earth-bound phenomena that influence our planet's movements. Recent research suggests that large earthquakes are more likely around full and new moons. That could be because the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned, increasing the gravitational force acting on our planet.  > Intense storms can also create faint seismic waves like those triggered by earthquakes  In a study published in September 2016, Satoshi Ide of the University of Tokyo and his colleagues analysed the tidal stresses in the two-week periods prior to large earthquakes in the last two decades. Of the largest 12 earthquakes, all of which had a magnitude of 8.2 or higher, nine happened close to full or new moons. No such relationship was found for smaller quakes.  Ide concluded that the extra gravitational force exerted at these times could increase the forces acting on tectonic plates. The changes would be small, but if the plates were under stress anyway, the extra force could be enough to turn small rock failures into larger ruptures.  While this may seem plausible, many scientists are sceptical because Ide's study only looked at 12 earthquakes.  **Sun shakes**  Even more controversial is the idea that vibrations originating deep within the Sun could help explain a number of shaking phenomena on Earth.  When gases move around inside the Sun, they produce two different types of waves. Those generated by changes in pressure are called p-modes, while those that form when dense material is pulled downwards by gravity are called g-modes.  A p-mode takes a few minutes to complete a full vibrational cycle, while a g-mode takes between tens of minutes and several hours. This amount of time is the mode's \"period\".  > Clearly, Thomson's idea might not pan out  In 1995, a group led by David Thomson of Queen's University in Kingston, Canada analysed patterns exhibited by the solar wind \u2013 a stream of charged particles that flows out from the Sun \u2013 between 1992 and 1994. They reported fluctuations that had the same periods as p-modes and g-modes, suggesting these solar vibrations were somehow influencing the solar wind.  In 2007, Thomson went on to report that unexplained fluctuations in the voltages of undersea communications cables, seismic measurements on Earth and even mobile phone call dropouts also had frequency patterns that matched the waves inside the Sun.  However, other scientists believe Thomson's claims are on shaky ground. According to simulations, these solar vibrations, especially the g-modes, should be so weak by the time they get to the Sun's surface that they could not affect the solar wind. Even if that is not the case, the patterns should be destroyed by turbulence in the interplanetary medium long before they get to Earth.  \"When we looked at different time periods, the frequencies he had identified were shifting around, when to be g-modes in particular they should remain fairly constant,\" says Pete Riley of Predictive Science in San Diego, California. Back in 1996 he published a study questioning Thomson's original results. \"We looked at the same data Dave Thomson looked at and applied the same analysis, and couldn't find any evidence for p-modes or g-modes.\"  Clearly, Thomson's idea might not pan out. But there are plenty of other reasons why our planet wobbles and shakes.  _Join over six million BBC Earth fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram._  _If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Iraq's second city, Mosul, was declared \"liberated\" on 10 July, almost nine months after pro-government forces launched a major offensive with air and ground support from a US-led multinational coalition.  In Syria, a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters is besieging Raqqa, the de facto capital of the \"caliphate\" proclaimed by IS in 2014.  Syrian troops and allied militiamen are also advancing to the south after recapturing the ancient heritage site of Palmyra from IS for the second time in March.  A report in June 2017 by IHS Conflict Monitor said IS had lost more than 60% of the territory it controlled in Iraq and Syria in January 2015.  IS came to the world's attention in June 2014, when its fighters overran Mosul and then moved southwards towards the capital Baghdad, routing the Iraqi army and threatening to eradicate the country's many ethnic and religious minorities.  At its peak, some 10 million people were living in territory under IS control.  The US special presidential envoy to the coalition, Brett McGurk, says coalition-supported operations have now cleared 65,000 sq km (25,000 sq miles) and freed 4 million people.  * * *  ## How did IS spread across Iraq and Syria?  The jihadists exploited the chaos and divisions within both Syria and Iraq.  IS grew out of what was al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was formed by Sunni militants after the US-led invasion in 2003 and became a major force in the country's sectarian insurgency.  In 2011, the group joined the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, where it found a safe haven and easy access to weapons.  At the same time, it took advantage of the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, as well as widespread Sunni anger at the sectarian policies of the country's Shia-led government.  In 2013, the group began seizing control of territory in Syria and changed its name to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis or Isil).  The following year, Isis overran large swathes of northern and western Iraq, proclaimed the creation of a \"caliphate\", and became known as \"Islamic State\".  A subsequent advance into areas controlled by Iraq's Kurdish minority, and the killing or enslaving of thousands of members of the Yazidi religious group, prompted the US-led coalition to begin air strikes on IS positions in Iraq in August 2014.  ## Casualties  Exact numbers of casualties from the conflict with IS are not available.  The UN says at least 6,878 civilians were killed in acts of violence in Iraq in 2016 and another 2,429 so far this year - although the true figure is likely to be higher as the organisation has been unable to verify some reports of casualties in the Mosul area.  According to Iraq body count, the total number of civilian deaths in Iraq since 2014 is more than 64,800.  The UN no longer keeps track of casualty figures in Syria due to the inaccessibility of many areas and the conflicting reports from the various parties to the war there.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported in July 2017 that more than 475,000 people, including 99,600 civilians, had been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began March 2011.  * * *  ## Who is fighting IS?  The US-led coalition has conducted more than 12,200 air strikes against IS targets in Iraq since August 2014.  Most attacks have been carried out by US aircraft, but those from Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands and the UK have also taken part.  In Syria, the air campaign began in September 2014. Since then, about 10,200 strikes have been carried out by coalition forces, which include Australia, Bahrain, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the UK.  The number of strikes each month rose steadily in Iraq up to a peak in January 2016 and then began to fall as the number of strikes in Syria increased dramatically, reaching a high of 880 in June 2017.  Russia is not part of the coalition, but its jets began air strikes against what it called \"terrorists\" in Syria in September 2015.  There is little information from official sources about the Russian air strikes. However, the Institute for the Study of War says evidence suggests Russian planes have targeted deep into opposition-held territory, and helped Syrian government forces to retake control of the city of Aleppo in December 2016.  Where key countries stand  What is Russia's endgame in Syria?  * * *  ## Other countries targeted by IS  With the proclamation of a caliphate at the end of June 2014, IS signalled its intention to spread beyond Iraq and Syria.  IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi quickly received oaths of the allegiance from jihadist militants in Libya, and within a year affiliates held territory in five countries and had footholds in several more.  By August 2016, IS was reported to be operational in 18 countries across the world, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to evidence seen by the US National Counterterrorism Center. It also found signs of what it called \"aspiring branches\" in Mali, Egypt, Somalia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines.  During 2016, IS also claimed attacks in a number of countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia, France, Belgium, Germany, the US and Bangladesh. In 2017, IS has claimed to be behind at least two attacks in the UK.  The proclamation of the caliphate triggered a surge in the number of foreign fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq to join IS.  A report published in December 2015 by the New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that 27,000 foreign jihadists had made the trip from 86 countries - more than half of them from the Middle East and North Africa.  * * *  ## The future of IS in Iraq and Syria  The coalition called the victory in Mosul a \"decisive blow\" against IS. But the group still controls parts of Iraq as well as a large swathe of eastern Syria.  Rebuilding Mosul is being seen as a major challenge for the Iraqi government. One Iraqi official estimated it would cost $1 billion to rebuild, others have put the figure far higher.  The top US commander in Iraq has also urged the government to \"reach out and reconcile with the Sunni population\" to prevent \"ISIS 2.0 from emerging\".  UN special representative Jan Kubis said the victory in Mosul provided an \"outstanding opportunity for Iraq to rise again strong and united\".  In Syria, human rights activists have warned that hundreds of civilians have been killed in the battle for Raqqa, which began in June 2017. A US spokesman said the city, like Mosul, was a \"critical element\" in the battle against IS.  Palmyra was one of several ancient sites that IS ransacked and demolished. IS fighters were driven out in March 2016 but managed to retake the city in December. It was finally recaptured again in March 2017.  ##  Interactive Use the slider below to compare before and after images  ### September 2015  ![](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_12630/img/temple-of- bel-after.jpg?1)  ### August 2015  ![](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_12630/img/temple-of- bel-before.jpg?1)  European Space Imaging, Digital Globe  Palmyra: Islamic State's demolition in the desert  * * *  ## How does IS get its funding?  Oil was once the biggest single source of revenue for IS. The group seized control of many oil fields in Syria and Iraq, and sold oil on the black market.  But revenue has fallen since IS lost control of oil-producing areas in northern Syrian and western Iraq, and US-led coalition and Russian air strikes began targeting oil infrastructure.  Income from taxes and fees has also fallen as IS has lost control of major cities like Mosul and other populated areas.  Money obtained by looting and fines initially increased, especially when IS seized Mosul in 2014, but has since declined.  At one point, IS was reported to be so short of funds that it was imposing random fines for offences like driving on the wrong side of the road.  According to a report by IHS Markit, territorial losses are the main factor contributing to IS's loss of revenue. It says the group's ability to compensate for financial losses by increasing the fiscal burden on the population it controls appears to have reached its limits.  The struggle to stay rich  * * *  ## Where are the refugees?  More than 5 million Syrians have fled abroad to escape the fighting in Syria, according to the UN. Most have ended up in neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.  About 950,000 Syrians have applied for asylum in Europe since April 2011, according to UN figures.  The UN estimates there are more than 3 million Iraqis who have been forced to leave their homes to escape the conflict with IS and are displaced within the country.  The battle for control of Mosul led to more than 920,000 people fleeing their homes for nearby refugee camps or relatives' homes.", "newsHeadline": "Islamic State and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838034", "countriesMentioned": ["Iraq", "Turkey", "Egypt", "France", "Jordan", "Australia", "Indonesia", "Russian Federation", "Belgium", "Bahrain", "Tanzania, United Republic of", "Bangladesh", "Afghanistan", "Denmark", "Mali", "Lebanon", "Somalia", "Pakistan", "United States", "Canada", "Syria"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Telegram app on a mobile phone](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1316A/production/_96968187_gettyimages-688189012.jpg) Image copyright Getty Images  Messaging service Telegram has promised to shut down terrorist-related channels after Indonesia's government partially blocked access to its platform.  The Ministry of Communication and IT blocked Telegram's web version on Friday and threatened to stop access to its app as well.  Jakarta claimed Telegram had been used to promote radicalism and to give instructions for carrying out attacks.  The firm's founder said he was \"upset\" by the move.

The group has claimed involvement in a string of attacks in Indonesia this year, and has fought running battles against the army at Marawi, on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines.

Shortly before travelling to Syria via Turkey, the girl had reportedly converted to Islam and been in contact with IS members online.  She had been under investigation for allegedly preparing for a possible act of terrorism, but prosecutors suspended the probe following her disappearance.  On Tuesday, the chief prosecutor in the German state of Saxony, Lorenz Haase, said officials were reviewing new evidence and that the investigation would resume if the girl \"reappears and is conclusively identified\".  An Iraqi official told Reuters news agency he believed the girl was of Slavic origin, possibly Russian. She had been taken to a hospital for treatment for burns after being detained, and would probably be handed over to her country's diplomatic mission and not kept in Iraq, he added.

They are not much to look at \u2013 the insects start life as unsightly worm-like larvae \u2013 and their behaviour is, frankly, terrifying: if they are not vomiting into the mouth of an adult they are greedily devouring each other.  But grown-up ants do not simply tolerate this behaviour in their youngsters \u2013 they depend on it. Researchers now suspect that ant larvae play a far-reaching role that is vital to the cohesion of the complex societies they are born into.  \"Larvae may be a distinct social caste with a specific function, without which a colony would not work,\" says Eva Schultner of the University of Regensburg in Germany, who studies the role of developing individuals in ant colonies.  The young of some insects, like termites, are often shaped like mini-adults, complete with tiny legs. Ant larvae are rarely blessed with such features. Their limbless bodies seem to make them incapable of much movement, giving the impression that they are merely passive objects dependent on adult care. They do not even have antennae, which adults use to sense their surroundings and communicate \u2013 so biologists once assumed they would not interact with their environment.  However, looks can be deceiving.  Some ant larvae signal to adults that they are hungry by swaying and moving their blobby bodies in distinct ways. Others, like the larvae of bulldog ants, stand upright. Some larvae are actually mobile despite their lack of legs. They can crawl towards insect or worm prey brought to the nest by workers.  Moreover, ant grubs conceal unusual body features. The tiny, elongated heads of developing _Myrmecina_ ants, for instance, are perfectly adapted for feeding. Adults will tear open a mite and present it to the larvae, which then sink their elongated heads into the carcass and consume its contents.  _Leptothorax_ ant larvae have a complementary feature: unique structures on their bellies act as food baskets, allowing them to hold onto their prey.  > Some ant larvae have a sound-producing organ that allows them to communicate  A close-up view of many larvae reveals that their bodies are covered with hairs, often specialised for different functions. In wood ants, the hairs act like Velcro, binding larvae to each other so that workers can easily transport them. Older larvae of another ant species, _Pheidole rhea__,_ have hooks on the end of their hairs, which allow adults to attach them to the walls of their nests. Workers are thought to hang up the brood as a way of organising them and determining feeding times. Ponerine ants have a similar system except they use sticky, pimple-like structures as hooks.  Hairs may act not only as anchors, though: they may help larvae communicate. Wasp larvae use hairs as their main sensing organ. When in their nests, they can detect vibrations when adults tap on the walls. Vibrational cues are also thought to play a role in determining whether a young wasp develops into a worker or a queen. Hairs might be used in a similar way in ant larvae, says Schultner \u2013 although no one has done the studies that would confirm the idea.  Instead of hairs, some ant larvae have a sound-producing organ that allows them to communicate. Karsten Schonrogge from the NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, UK found that, once the outer shell of some _Myrmica_ ant pupae toughens, a specialised organ forms to allow them to make calls. Older ants typically use chemical signals to communicate, but the researchers think that the tough outer skin of pupae may block the secretion of pheromones, encouraging them to resort to sound in order to communicate. Rubbing noises seem to convey a high social status since larvae that belong to a lower class are mute.  Some ant larvae have physical features that benefit the entire colony. Larval weaver ants produce silk to spin their cocoons, but adults also use the silk to construct their nests. It is mostly female larvae that are recruited for this task, which suggests division of labour among larvae.  Meanwhile, during floods some ant species exploit the natural buoyancy of their larvae to help save the colony. _Formica selysi_ants physically link together to form rafts in order to survive the deluge. Larvae, which float more easily, are always placed on the raft base \u2013 and despite the risky position they usually survive.  > Amblyopone silvestrii ants will puncture a larva's skin to access ducts on its abdomen and drink its blood, vampire style  Larval behaviour may be even more bizarre than their little-known physical features. For example, they often act as \"communal stomachs\" . Adults have such a thin waist that they can only consume fluids. Larvae eat insects on behalf of the adults and then produce a protein-rich liquid for their elders to eat.  Larvae food-processing tactics can vary. Young poneromorph ants, for example, start digesting insects externally using saliva, before ingesting them and regurgitating the digested remains into a worker's mouth. The worker, in turn, feeds the spewed-out protein to its queen, which is vital for her to produce eggs.  Other larvae, such as those of the ant species _Pheidole spadonia_, help the adults process food in a slightly different way. In one experiment, biologists discovered that the worker ants rely on the larvae to soften up prey. The workers dismembered fruit flies and then placed the small, tough body parts under a larva's mouth, in grooves specialised for holding food. The larva would then drool on the fly remains, coating them with saliva that digested and softened the tissue. Sometimes the larva pierced the food with its jaws, to allow digestive enzymes to penetrate and speed up the process. Eventually, workers suck up the soft tissue and feed some of it back to the larva.  Ant larvae sometimes provide for the adults in an even more macabre way. _Amblyopone silvestrii_ ants will puncture a larva's skin to access ducts on its abdomen and drink its blood, vampire style. These ants prey on large centipedes, which are not always available, so biologists think their blood- sucking behaviour is an adaptation to supplement their diet. Other _Amblyopone_ ants squeeze a larva's neck to extract drops of saliva. _Solenopsis_ ants pinch a larva's rear end to release milky-looking anal droplets full of recycled nutrients.  > Larvae were in fact delaying worker reproduction  Dead larvae can also be eaten whole, as long as they have not died as the result of a contagious disease. And in more extreme cases, when there are food shortages, larvae may have to take one for the team: they are killed and eaten. \"They are ready-made protein packages available in a colony,\" says Schultner. \"If a queen is at risk of starving, she will be fed larvae or pupae.\"  By playing a key role in supplying food, larvae have control over the reproductive success of the colony. Since a queen needs protein provided by grubs to produce eggs, her fecundity increases when more larvae are around. Moreover, with pharaoh ants (_Monomorium pharaonis_), larvae seem to actively choose which adults to donate secretions to, so as not to frivolously give away nutrients. They readily hand over their juices to mature queens that have mated, but deny them to young, sexually active queens and virgins. Chemical signals may help them assess a queen's fecundity.  Larvae can regulate reproduction in other ways, too. Although worker ants can usually produce their own offspring, they typically hold off when a queen is around and look after her eggs instead. Jessie Ebie from Arizona State University in Tempe and her colleagues wanted to find out how _Novomessor cockerelli_ workers, which live in colonies spread out over many unconnected nests, know that there is a fertile queen somewhere in the system without having contact with her_._  Workers produce eggs that look identical to the queen's eggs, so Ebie and her team initially suspected that a chemical marker on the queen's eggs helped make the distinction clear and encourage the worker ants to stop laying their own eggs. \"We were surprised to find that it wasn't the eggs,\" says Ebie. \"Larvae were in fact delaying worker reproduction.\"  When workers were surrounded by queen-produced eggs, they continued to lay eggs as normal. But when the queen's larvae were present, the workers held off.  > Larvae may also be able to cannibalise intruders  Ebie is now trying to solve the mystery of how larvae inhibit offspring production. They could be releasing pheromones, or workers might simply become depleted of nutrients they need to reproduce after supplying larvae with food. \"Workers produce eggs that aren't viable to feed larvae and the queen,\" says Ebie.  However, the most enigmatic behaviour of all may be cannibalism. Ant larvae will sometimes eat other larvae \u2013 a perplexing behaviour for a social species where cooperation and self-sacrifice usually rule. \"Cannibalism is one of the most obvious selfish behaviours,\" says Schultner.  In a recent study, Schultner and her team investigated whether cannibalistic larvae could be helping their close relatives. Ant colonies can be made up of groups of ants that are not closely related, sometimes bringing together hundreds or thousands of different families. The researchers suspected that larvae may be more likely to dine on individuals who are distant relatives rather than close cousins. Getting rid of unrelated offspring would help their family take over the colony.  By comparing eight species of ants with a range of relatedness in their colonies, Schultner and her colleagues found that levels of cannibalism among larvae were lower in nests housing close siblings. This suggests larvae are able to distinguish between close and less-close relatives \u2013 although how they do this is unclear.  \"They are capable of assessing their environment and reacting differently to different social contexts,\" says Schultner. Male larvae were also more likely to practise cannibalism compared to females, although again, it is still a mystery why this should be so.  Larvae may also be able to cannibalise intruders. Many ants are social parasites and will establish a new colony by stealing another species' home. A young queen will typically enter a foreign nest and lay her eggs, tricking the resident workers to rear them. Over time, her offspring will take over.  > A thriving ant colony is usually the product of its humble larval origins  Schultner and her team are now keen to find out whether larvae are able to help defend their homes through cannibalism. Since an invading queen typically is not attacked and killed directly, they suspect that host larvae could be fighting undercover by targeting her eggs instead. \"We noticed that larvae seem to react differently to different types of eggs, so maybe they recognise the parasite eggs and eat them,\" says Schultner.  Preliminary results seem to support their hypothesis. But figuring out how the larvae can tell eggs apart will be the next challenge. Adults use their antennae to sense their surroundings, including picking up smells, but larvae do not have feelers or odour-detecting organs. The larvae of some other insects have smell receptors elsewhere on their bodies \u2013 and it is possible ant larvae might follow this pattern. \"It implies that they can assess their chemical environment,\" says Schultner.  Larvae may shed their many powers as they mature into majestic adult ants, but their childhood leaves its mark. For example, baby ants learn the odour of their nestmates early on, which seems to influence their ability to recognise colony members as adults. Their nutrition and environment as larvae also influences whether they will become workers or queens \u2013 and they reach their maximum body size before adulthood.  In fact, in many ways the future of the colony \u2013 and of its descendants \u2013 depends on larvae. What happens to larva during their development can generate characteristics that are passed to new generations through natural selection. A thriving ant colony is usually the product of its humble larval origins.  \"It's not so important what they do as adults,\" says Schultner. \"What they do during development will influence their success later in life.\"  _Join over six million BBC Earth fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram._  _If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Militants linked to so-called Islamic State have been occupying parts of Marawi, a city in the south, since May.  President Rodrigo Duterte said the extension was necessary to crush the insurgency, but his critics say it is part of a wider power grab.  Mindanao is home to a number of Muslim rebel groups seeking more autonomy.  Martial law allows the use of the military to enforce law and the detention of people without charge for long periods.  It is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, where martial law was imposed by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos for much of his rule.  Image copyright AFP Image caption The streets of Marawi have been left virtually deserted since the insurgency began  A previously imposed 60-day martial rule was due to expire on Saturday. It went into effect on 23 May, just hours after deadly clashes between the army and gunmen linked to so-called Islamic State.  The extension means the law will now remain in force until 31 December.  In May, President Duterte warned that martial law could be extended across the Philippines after insurgents killed police officers in Marawi.  Some opposition lawmakers questioned why it should be applied to the whole of the southern island, instead of just the city.  \"I fear that the plan to extend the martial law in Mindanao will pave the way for a Philippines-wide martial law,\" Senator Risa Hontiveros was quoted by AFP as saying.  Another senator, Franklin Drilon, said the extension was too long, while congressman Edcel Lagman said there was \"no factual basis\" for it.  A dozen protesters also interrupted proceedings at Saturday's hearing, chanting \"never again to martial law\", the news agency reports.  Army chief of staff General Eduardo Ano said it was necessary to restrict the movement of the Islamist militants, warning that the ongoing rebellion could spread to other cities on the island, the GMA News website reports.

Marawi was home to 200,000 residents but many have fled the violence. There are fears for those trapped who face a lack of food and water.  More than 420 militants, 100 soldiers and 45 civilians have been killed in the fighting.  Clashes began when the army failed in its attempt to capture Isnilon Hapilon, believed to be the main IS leader in the Philippines and linked to the local Maute group, which has declared allegiance to IS.

The UN's refugee agency has told the BBC how it and its partners are gearing up to deal with the expected humanitarian crisis by building camps to house those in need.  The much-delayed operation to drive IS from Iraq's second-largest city is expected to begin this month, more than two years after the jihadists over-ran Mosul and proclaimed its caliphate.  In preparation, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and its partners are stepping up contingency plans, informed by a number of lessons learned from previous offensives, such as Falluja, says Bruno Geddo, the UNHCR Iraq Representative.  For example, the Iraqi army has been encouraging the residents of Mosul to stay in their homes when possible instead of taking to the open roads, where they could be vulnerable to attack.  \"Isis [IS] know where the routes out of the city are and they will kill people escaping,\" Mr Geddo says.  \"There is only a narrow route which is safe to travel through. If too many people try to use them there will be bottlenecks, which are always dangerous. They are easy to attack.\"  Mr Geddo hopes the Iraqi army will be successful in keeping people in their homes, but says such a plan will be difficult to enforce. For this reason, the UNHCR and its partners are preparing for the worst.  \"If [the situation in the city] is arranged in a proper way - everything will be controlled by the Iraqi army - people will not be allowed to flee Mosul,\" he says.  \"If the outflow is uncontrolled there will be chaos and desperation.\"  ## 'A million people displaced'  An estimated 3.3 million people - equivalent to almost 10% of the population of Iraq - have been uprooted by fighting since the start of 2014. Those currently fleeing Mosul and its surrounding areas join about half-a-million people who fled the city in June 2014.  There are no firm figures on how many people remain in Mosul, but there were more than two million when IS took the city more than two years ago.  Mr Geddo estimates the population could now be \"anywhere between 1.2 and 1.5m people\".  ##  Mosul offensive: the human cost  ###  UN high estimates  1,000,000  internally displaced people  700,000  requiring temporary accommodation    * 120,000 spaces in UN camps     * 300,000 spaces with UN partners     * 280,000 currently uncatered for   Source: Bruno Geddo, UN High Commission for Refugees  Getty Images  As a result, the UN believes up to one million people could be displaced by the forthcoming military action, and some 700,000 of those, they believe, will need shelter.  It warns it could be one of the largest man-made displacement crises of recent times.  With current funding levels, the UNHCR says it is able to provide accommodation for 20,000 families - or 120,000 people.  Other groups working alongside the agency estimate they can help a further 50,000 families.  ## Emergency camps  \"We will have five new permanent camps up by the end of October and hope to provide 20 more emergency camps closer to the theatre of conflict,\" says Mr Geddo.  Due to protection concerns, the locations of these emergency camps cannot currently be revealed.  * * *    * An \"emergency shelter kit\" is given to families when tents are not available in camps   * Each pack costs between $79 and $87 (\u00a365-\u00a370)   * The UN currently has 50,000 such kits, with 5,000 arriving in Iraq each week from 18 October. Some 30,000 more will be provided by UN partners from November.  * * *  The emergency camps will need to be closer to the city to look after civilians as soon as they escape and will therefore suffer from \"a substantial risk\" of \"mortar or shell attacks\", Mr Geddo warns.  So far, he says, the UN has identified locations for four of the emergency camps, but explains the challenge is finding safe places with the right terrain for shelter as well as a water supply.  In the past, there have also been issues with private landowners unwilling to lease land to the UN.  Image copyright NRC/Iraq Image caption Members of the Norwegian Refugee Council, a UN partner, hand out emergency kits to displaced people in western Iraq  In order to try and create more space for fleeing families, the UN will attempt to move residents out of camps quickly to more permanent accommodation.  One option is a \"sponsorship arrangement\", Mr Geddo explains, where civilians are sponsored by a family member, a business or a charity.  If they are able to prove that they will be looked after at their destination, the UN will then assist them in making the journey.  Another problem facing the UNHCR, he says, is that a number of civilians may try to escape the fighting by travelling to Syria, where the UN is working with groups to try to ensure people's safety.  \"This is more difficult of course, but it could ease some pressure on our camps in Iraq.\"  ## Raising funds  The process of securing funding for the relief effort has been a challenge, but has improved since previous crises, Mr Geddo explains.  Previously, large donations only started to come in once action appeared on television screens on the news.  But because this offensive has been a long time in the planning, the UN has already managed to raise half of its $284m (\u00a3232m) target.  \"There is never enough money for any humanitarian situation, but we are more prepared this time,\" Mr Geddo says.  ## Vetting for IS  Another lesson learned, he says, is regarding the vetting of those entering the camps.  Accusations that Shia militiamen had previously carried out abuse during security checks means the process will now be carried out solely by the Iraqi army.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Workers prepare a tent camp in Khazer, west of the Kurdish regional capital Irbil for people expected to flee Mosul  \"[The vetting process] is absolutely key. This will be the first interaction many people have had after two years under IS control. It must be completely clear that we are helping and that the procedure is a normal one.  \"No men will be allowed access to UN camps unless they have been fully security screened,\" Mr Geddo says. \"The process could take several days.\"  ## Human shields  Mr Geddo also suggested there were possible signs that IS in Mosul was running out of funds.  Those fleeing have described how the fighters are now accepting cash payments to allow people to escape the city.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Iraqi families fleeing Mosul are reunited at a camp  \"Previously, the only way to get out was with a smuggler,\" explains Mr Geddo. \"The person would pay $2,000, but it was very dangerous. Both the smuggler and the family would be killed if they were caught trying to escape.  \"But recently, we have heard stories - this is not confirmed information - that Isis are accepting a higher payment of $10,000 and will allow people to leave.\"  However, Mr Geddo adds, IS may want many of the city's residents to stay put until the battle begins in order to use them for their own tactical benefit.  \"When [the civilians] flee, they will try to slow down the coalition forces by using civilians as human shields.\"  This would be yet another aspect to the crisis that the UN and its partners would have to be prepared for.", "newsHeadline": "Battle for Mosul: UN prepares for aftermath 'chaos' - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37643228", "countriesMentioned": ["Iraq"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi making what would have been his first public appearance, at a mosque in the centre of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8D91/production /_96514263_1a1a04bf-70b1-48a0-8698-3a703f4b0c0d.jpg) Image copyright Reuters Image caption Baghdadi emerged from the shadows, appearing in Mosul in June 2014  Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri, otherwise known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was born in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, to a lower-middle class Sunni family.  His family was known for its piety and his tribe claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad.  As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law.  His family nicknamed him \"the Believer\" because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards.  Baghdadi pursued his religious interests at university. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad in 1996, and a Master's and PhD in Koranic studies from Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies in 1999 and 2007 respectively.  Until 2004, Baghdadi spent his graduate school years living in the Tobchi neighbourhood of Baghdad with his two wives and six children.  He taught Koranic recitation to neighbourhood children at the local mosque, where he was also the star of its football club.  During Baghdadi's time in graduate school, his uncle persuaded him to join the Muslim Brotherhood.  Baghdadi quickly gravitated towards the few violent ultra-conservatives in the Islamist movement and by 2000, under their tutelage, had embraced Salafist jihadism.  ## Activist to insurgent  Within months of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Baghdadi helped found the insurgent group Jaysh Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamaah (Army of the People of the Sunnah and Communal Solidarity).  In February 2004, US forces arrested Baghdadi in Falluja and sent him to a detention facility at Camp Bucca, where he remained for 10 months.  While in detention, Baghdadi devoted himself to religious matters, leading prayers, preaching Friday sermons, and conducting classes for prisoners.  Image copyright AFP Image caption The US held Baghdadi at a detention centre in Iraq for 10 months  According to a fellow inmate, Baghdadi was taciturn but had a knack for moving between the rival factions at the facility, where former Saddam loyalists and jihadists mingled.  Baghdadi formed alliances with many of them and stayed in touch when he was freed in December 2004.  After his release, Baghdadi contacted a spokesman for al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a local al-Qaeda affiliate run by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.  Impressed with Baghdadi's religious scholarship, the spokesman convinced Baghdadi to go to Damascus, where he was to ensure AQI's propaganda adhered to the principles of ultra-conservative Islam.  Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 by a US air strike and was succeeded by an Egyptian, Abu Ayyub al-Masri.  That October, Masri dissolved AQI and founded the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). The group continued to privately pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda.  ## The new emir  Because of Baghdadi's religious credentials and his ability to bridge the divide between the foreigners who founded ISI and the local Iraqis who later joined the group, Baghdadi steadily rose through the ranks.  He was appointed supervisor of the Sharia Committee and named to the 11-member Shura Council that advised ISI's emir, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi.  Image copyright EPA Image caption Baghdadi exploited the chaos in Syria to gain a foothold there for Islamic State  Baghdadi was later appointed to ISI's Co-ordination Committee, which oversaw communication with the group's commanders in Iraq.  After the deaths of ISI's founder and its emir in April 2010, the Shura Council chose Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be the new emir.  Baghdadi set about rebuilding the organisation, which had been decimated by US special operations forces.  Hoping to capitalise on growing unrest in Syria in 2011, Baghdadi ordered one of his Syrian operatives to establish a secret branch of ISI in the country, later known as al-Nusra Front.  ## Advent of Isis  Baghdadi soon fell out with the leader of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, who wanted to collaborate with the mainstream Sunni rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.  But Baghdadi wanted to establish his own state through brute force before going after Assad.  In the spring of 2013, Baghdadi announced that al-Nusra was part of ISI, which he renamed \"Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant\" (Isis/Isil).  Image copyright Reuters Image caption So-called Islamic State was formed in defiance of the al-Qaeda leadership  When al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to grant al-Nusra its independence, Baghdadi refused. In February 2014, Zawahiri expelled Isis from al-Qaeda.  Isis responded by fighting al-Nusra and consolidating its hold on eastern Syria, where Baghdadi imposed harsh religious laws.  Its stronghold secure, Baghdadi ordered his men to expand into western Iraq.  ## The caliph  In June 2014, Isis captured Iraqi's second largest city, Mosul, and soon after, the group's spokesman proclaimed the return of the caliphate, renaming Isis \"Islamic State\".  Days later, Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon in Mosul and declared himself caliph.  The media has wrongly reported Baghdadi's demise several times.  But if he dies, the organisation will lose a skilled mediator, a ruthless politician, a religious scholar, and a man of noble lineage - an unusual combination for the leader of a global militant organisation, much less a proto-state.  _William McCants is the author of The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State.

Ethnic rivalries, as well as sectarian and religious sensitivities, will have to be respected if the offensive is not to go horribly wrong.  The Iraqi army which scattered and fled as IS fighters drove and rode into Mosul in 2014 was mocked as I.R.A.Q. or I Ran Away Quickly.  But the soldiers may have been running not only from IS.  The mostly Sunni Arabs of Mosul resented the domination of the central Baghdad government by Shia Muslims.  Junior ranks in the Iraqi army were afraid that they would be attacked by Sunni Arabs in Mosul as well as IS, taking revenge for the transformation of Iraq into what they perceived to be a Shia state.  For the same reason, IS in Mosul has enjoyed strong political and logistical support from former members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist armed forces, men who were summarily dismissed and who lost their livelihoods in the de- Baathification process after 2003.  The sectarian policies of the first elected prime minister Nouri Maliki may have led some Mosulites to welcome \"Islamic State\".  The Shia government in Baghdad had allowed the pendulum of political adjustment in Iraq to swing so far that the large Sunni minority felt downtrodden, marginalised, and collectively blamed for Saddam Hussein's cruelty towards the Shia majority.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Haider al-Abadi has tried to reconcile marginalised Sunnis  But the new prime minister Haider al-Abadi - also Shia of course - has worked hard to bring Sunnis back into the fold.  For example, he has funded and armed Sunni Arab tribal forces which are expected to play a prominent role in the imminent battle for Mosul.  The remaining residents, especially in the city centre, are more likely to welcome them than the mostly Shia Iraqi army, the irregular Shia \"Popular Mobilisation Forces\", or the Kurdish Peshmerga.  Meanwhile the remaining IS fighters have driven out, or massacred, the Christians, Yazidis and Kurds who used to live there.  Thousands of Sunni Arabs too have also left Mosul.  If they ever believed that IS was a potentially sympathetic group of Sunni co- religionists, they were quickly disabused as the conquerors of Mosul revealed themselves to be irrational psychopaths who, for example, force children to watch public executions.  ## Exodus expected  Hundreds of thousands of people - possibly a million - are expected to flee Mosul ahead of the forthcoming battle.  As IS still occupies Tal Afar to the west and Hawija down the Tigris to the south, most fleeing families are likely to go east towards Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands of people fled Mosul when it was taken by IS, now a new flight is expected  Extra pontoon bridges have been installed across two rivers on that route, and some refugee camps have been prepared.  But it's not clear if Iraqi Kurdistan can really cope with a mass exodus from Mosul, or with columns of refugees who may have IS fighters concealed among them.  Between 3,000 and 5,000 IS fighters remain in Mosul, the Pentagon says, while the number of Sunni Arab tribal fighters ready to fight them there and in nearby towns is estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000.  Approximately half of them have been trained by Turkish forces based at Bashiqa, a military camp between Mosul and the Turkish border.  ## Turkey-Iraq tensions  There are also Turkish troops on the ground in northern Iraq - and some Turkish tanks too - thanks to an agreement with the Kurdish regional government; but not by agreement with the government in Baghdad.  This has led to a tetchy exchange between Baghdad and Ankara.  One of Turkey's objectives is to prevent consolidation of power by Kurds in this strongly Kurdish corner of the Middle East.  There are about 150,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters available for the recovery of Mosul, but only 2,500 trained and ready for battle.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most US troops in Iraq are from the 101st Airborne Division  The United States recently agreed to give the Peshmerga $415m (\u00a3340m) to pay their soldiers, and to buy fuel, food and ammunition.  They have also supplied some heavy weapons - but not enough, according to Iraqi Kurdish commanders.  There are also about 5,000 American forces in Iraq now, many of them from the 101st Airborne Division which occupied Mosul in 2003.  Others are believed to be special forces, many of them training and supporting thousands of Sunni tribal fighters.  Ten years ago, the Americans helped Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province west of Baghdad form the 'Awakening' movement to defeat a previous incarnation of violent fundamentalist Islam - al-Qaeda in Iraq.  After US troops mostly left Iraq, it was the failure of the Maliki government to continue supporting the Awakening which helped the self-styled Islamic State move in and and occupy key cities like Ramadi, Fallujah, Tikrit... and Mosul.", "newsHeadline": "Battle for Mosul must navigate ethnic rivalries - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37656019", "countriesMentioned": ["Iraq", "Turkey", "Afghanistan", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Map of Iraq](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/54625000/gif/_54625638_iraq.gif)  Iraq, in an area once home to some of the earliest civilisations, became a battleground for competing forces after the US-led ousting of President Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Improved relations between the central government and the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government made possible the signing of a deal in December 2014 on sharing Iraq's oil wealth and military resources.  It was hoped this would help build the consensus needed to enable the country to face the common threat represented by the armed Islamic State group, which by the end of 2014 had advanced into northern and central Iraq.  However, his administration has been dogged by accusations of corruption and the charge that the allocation of posts according to sectarian quotas takes precedence over competence.  ## MEDIA  Image copyright Getty Images  There are hundreds of publications and scores of radio and TV stations.

While promising a fierce fight to the end, IS prepared the way in its propaganda for its military defeat in the city.  The group began to shift its messaging in May 2016 amid losses in its Iraqi and Syrian heartland, saying that victory was not determined by territorial hold but persistence in faith.  It emphasised its enduring ideological reach, insisting that the group was invincible even if it faced what it portrayed as temporary setbacks on the ground.  IS cited a military official as saying the group had begun readying for its battle to defend Mosul from the first day it captured the city, suggesting the group knew its hold on the city could never last.  ## Eyes elsewhere  Following the launch by Iraqi forces of the operation to recapture Mosul in October 2016, IS has played up the strength of its affiliates in other countries.  It recently suggested that the capture of parts of the city of Marawi in the Philippines by pro-IS militants in May was reminiscent of its capture of Mosul, indicating that the symbolic centre of its so-called \"caliphate\" could be revised.  Image caption Pro-IS militants remain holed up in Marawi despite an operation by the Philippine military  The group noted that a precursor had lost control of areas of Iraq in 2007 but resurfaced much stronger.  IS has demonstrated its ability to carry out attacks in various parts of Iraq outside Mosul, with a current offensive near Qayyara to the south of the city diverting attention from its crumbling \"caliphate\".  It has issued multiple calls for attacks worldwide, and in June claimed a third attack in the UK and its first attacks in Iran and Israel.  ## Graveyard  In the course of the battle for Mosul, IS has often said the city would prove to be a graveyard for its enemies.  But on 7 July it described Mosul's Old City as a graveyard for thousands of civilians, blaming their suffering on US-led coalition bombardment.  Image copyright Telegram/Amaq Image caption IS claimed the destruction of the al-Nuri mosque was a message from the US to Sunni Muslims  This served its narrative depicting an alleged global war against Sunni Islam.  IS used the destruction in Mosul - including the landmark Great Mosque al-Nuri and Hadba minaret, reportedly orchestrated by the group itself - to serve its own ends.  It boasted about the fierce resistance its members had put up in the city over almost nine months, against an array of powerful enemies.  It also gloated about the material and human cost visited upon its foes.  In a recent recognition of its demise in Mosul, the group said it planned to apply lessons derived from the protracted battle to future fronts in its unending war.  These are just some of the ways its media spins victory out of military defeats.  BBC Monitoring_ reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

In the footage, men wearing uniform throw an unarmed man over a cliff. They then shoot his motionless body.  An interior ministry spokesman said that if the video was authentic those responsible must be brought to justice.  Human rights groups say they have received numerous witness reports of torture and executions in Mosul.  Iraq's prime minister declared victory over IS in the city on Monday, after a nine-month battle that left large areas in ruins, killed thousands of civilians and displaced more than 920,000 others.  Troops are still clearing parts of the Old City, where as many as a couple of hundred militants may be hiding, according to commanders of the US-led coalition that supported the operation.  The BBC was unable to verify the authenticity of the video appearing to show the extrajudicial killing of a detainee, or say when or where it was filmed.  But Human Rights Watch said it had verified the location with satellite imagery.  The US-based group added that the video was one of four featuring alleged abuses that were posted online on Tuesday and Wednesday by an Iraqi man who regularly published information regarding security and military activities in and around Mosul.  Belkis Wille, senior Iraq researcher at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC: \"In the final weeks of the battle for west Mosul, the pervasive attitude that I have observed among armed forces has been of momentum, the desire to get the battle wrapped up as quickly as possible, and a collapse of adherences to the laws of war.\"  Numerous witnesses had reported not only a significant increase in the torture and extrajudicial killing of IS suspects by armed forces, but also a feeling among personnel that they no longer needed to conceal such actions, she said.  \"These reports have been met with congratulations from Baghdad on the victory, only further fostering the feeling of impunity among armed forces in Mosul.\"  At the end of June, Human Rights Watch published a report detailing allegations from four witnesses, who said they had seen Iraqi forces beat unarmed men and boys fleeing the fighting in Mosul and also obtained information about Iraqi forces killing unarmed men.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Another video purportedly showed IS militants who had surrendered in Mosul's Old City  One witness said that he had seen two Counter-Terrorism Service personnel take down the corpse of a suspected IS militant that had been strung up to an electrical pole, and stone the body before taking a few photos of each other posing with it. Later, he added, a CTS fighter showed him a video of a detainee being shot dead.  The Swedish newspaper Expressen also cited an Iraqi federal police officer as saying that he had decapitated at least 50 men with knives and beaten others. The article said the officer had backed up the claims with photos and videos.  Human Rights Watch has also said that Iraqi forces are detaining and holding thousands of men and boys in inhumane conditions without charge, under the guise of screening them for IS-affiliation.  On Thursday, the group reported that at least 170 families of alleged IS members had been sent to a closed camp in Bartella, east of Mosul, for \"psychological and ideological rehabilitation\".  Local authorities in Anbar, Babil, Diyala, Nineveh and Salahuddin provinces were also demanding the eviction of families thought to have ties to IS, it said.", "newsHeadline": "Iraq 'investigating Mosul cliff killing video' - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40593405?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story", "countriesMentioned": ["Iraq", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Maths performance graph](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/64695000/gif/_64695049_maths_achieve_304.gif)  Asian countries have taken top places in global school rankings for maths, science and reading, with England and Northern Ireland among high performers.  US academics have produced international comparisons in key subjects - using tests taken in 2011 by 900,000 pupils in over 60 countries.  It shows that Northern Ireland is Europe's top performing education system for primary maths.  England has slipped in science, but is top 10 for primary and secondary maths.  The top places in this global education league table have been taken by Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. Finland is among the highest placed European countries.  Such comparisons have become increasingly influential - measuring pupils against the standards of international competitor countries.  Globalisation in the jobs market and the economy has seen education ministers wanting to benchmark pupils' achievement against current international rivals.  Such international rankings have also highlighted the educational strength underpinning the emerging economic powers in Asia.  These latest rankings bring together two major studies - the four-yearly Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the five- yearly Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).  They reveal the continuing pattern of domination by a group of Asian education systems - South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong (such international comparisons include regional school systems as well as countries).  ## Science falls  But the study, compiled by researchers at Boston College in the US, shows that England and Northern Ireland are performing strongly in the following group of European education systems.  ## PRIMARY MATHS TOP 10    * Singapore    * South Korea    * Hong Kong   * Taiwan   * Japan   * Northern Ireland   * Belgium (Flemish)    * Finland    * England (6th in 2007)   * Russian Federation  Source: TIMSS 2011  In maths, the study says England has been one of the most improved between 1995 and 2011. England remains in the global top 10 for maths - in 9th for primary and 10th for secondary.  England has slipped in primary science tests, taken by 600,000 10 year olds - down to 15th place from 7th place in the last tests in 2007. There was also a dip for secondary science, taken by 14 year olds, down from 5th to 9th place.  In the literacy tests, taken by a sample of 325,000 primary school pupils, there was progress for England - up from 15th to 11th.  A spokesman for Education Secretary Michael Gove said: \"These tests reflect progress between 2006 and 2011 and were taken only a year after the election.  \"So to the limited extent the results reflect the effect of political leadership, Labour deserves the praise for the small improvement in reading and the blame for the stagnation in maths and the decline in science. The tests say nothing, good or bad, about what we have done.\"  Labour's education spokesman, Stephen Twigg, said: \"These results show schools in England are some of the best in Europe - thanks to the hard work of teachers and pupils. The Labour government's reforms saw reading results improve thanks to better teaching, smaller class sizes and Labour's National Literacy Strategy.  ## PRIMARY SCIENCE TOP 10    * Korea   * Singapore   * Finland   * Japan    * Russian Federation    * Taiwan   * US   * Czech   * Hong Kong   * Hungary   * (England 15th place)  Source: TIMSS 2011  \"However, we need to understand why East Asian countries out perform us in key skills - particularly science and maths.\"  Mr Twigg also highlighted the lower achievement for Sweden in reading - linking it to the free schools inspired by the Swedish education system.  There was a particularly strong performance for Northern Ireland - in 6th place for primary maths, which meant it was the highest ranking European school system.  Northern Ireland, taking part in these tests for the first time, is in 5th place for primary reading - in a top group alongside such education superpowers such as Finland and Hong Kong.  In terms of the proportion of pupils reaching the highest ability levels, Northern Ireland was even more successful, in 3rd place.  ## 'Safe and orderly  The maths study also ranked the \"safe and orderly\" levels of schools - and found Northern Ireland was at the top, with England in 14th place.  There was also a ranking of bullying for the primary maths study - with England having one of the worst records in Europe, in 30th place in terms of students' views of the levels of bullying.  Scotland and Wales did not take part in these rankings.  Such results show long-term trends, overlapping between different governments and education ministers. In England, the tests were taken under the current coalition government, but the pupils would have studied under the reforms of the previous Labour government.  ## PRIMARY READING TOP 10    * Hong Kong    * Russian Federation   * Finland   * Singapore   * Northern Ireland   * United States   * Denmark   * Croatia   * Taiwan   * Ireland   * (England 11th place)  Source: PIRLS 2011  Researchers say the factors linked to success are a supportive home background and schools which have good discipline and experienced and well-motivated teachers. They also mention negative social factors, such as too many older pupils having learning impaired by a lack of adequate sleep.  The maths study examined the availability of resources at home - such as books - with pupils in South Korea, Norway, Sweden and the US being the best equipped. Indonesia and Ghana had the least learning materials at home.  There is a broad pattern repeated across these tables, with a cluster of Asian, Pacific Rim, countries at the top, European and western countries in the upper and middle ranks, with countries in North Africa and the Middle East in the lower ranks.  Report author and Boston College professor, Michael Martin, said that the success of the top-performing countries reflects the long-term investment - and shows the way for other developing countries to follow.  \"Education is a multi-generational enterprise,\" he said.  \"One thing you can learn from these is what's possible. That comes as a shock sometimes, what students in other countries can actually do and the gap sometimes between what your students are achieving and what students in other countries are achieving,\" said Prof Martin.  There are other international rankings - but these also show a similar picture at the top of the table, with education systems such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Finland and England among the highest performers.  In global league tables assembled by Pearson last month, Finland and South Korea were top, with England in 6th place.  The less expected success of the TIMSS and PIRLS rankings will be the high performance of Russia, which has a place in all their top 10s.  Another prominent international ranking, the PISA tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has shown a strong performance for Chinese education systems, including Shanghai and Hong Kong.", "newsHeadline": "Asians top of school tables - England in maths top 10 - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/education-20664752", "countriesMentioned": ["Finland", "Singapore", "Sweden", "Ghana", "Indonesia", "Russian Federation", "Norway", "China", "Canada", "United States", "United Kingdom"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Maths scores](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/71493000/gif/_71493283_pisa_maths_results_464.gif)  The UK is falling behind global rivals in international tests taken by 15 -year-olds, failing to make the top 20 in maths, reading and science.  England's Education Secretary Michael Gove said since the 1990s, test performances had been \"at best stagnant, at worst declining\".  Shanghai in China is the top education system in the OECD's Pisa tests.  Within the UK, Scotland outperformed England at maths and reading, but Wales is below average in all subjects.  Mr Gove told MPs that his reforms, such as changing the curriculum, school autonomy and directing financial support towards poorer pupils, were designed to prevent schools in England from \"falling further behind\".  He highlighted the rapid improvements that had been made in countries such as Poland, Germany and Vietnam.  Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt called on Mr Gove to take some responsibility for the lack of progress and said the results showed that collaboration between schools and teachers was more effective than market forces.  ## 'Extremely sobering'  Graham Stuart, chair of the education select committee, said the results were \"extremely sobering\" and showed that \"we went nowhere\" despite massive investment in schools.  But the Pisa results should not be used to \"talk down our public education system\", said Chris Keates, leader of the NASUWT teachers' union, who argued that high performing countries were those which promoted the professionalism of teachers.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The gap between top and bottom of the league table equals six years of learning  In response to the particularly poor results in Wales, Education Minister Huw Lewis said: \"Everybody working in and around the Welsh education sector needs to take a long hard look in the mirror.\"  Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser for education company Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said the test result \"focuses minds in education ministries around the world like nothing else\".  ## What are the Pisa tests?    * International tests in maths, reading and science   * Tests are taken by 500,000 15 year old pupils in 65 countries and local administrations   * They are run every three years by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development   * In the UK, more than 12,000 pupils took the tests in 2012  Try the Pisa test yourself  Singapore maths method  The Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - have become the most influential rankings in international education, based on tests taken by more than 500,000 secondary school pupils.  These measure education standards in Europe, North and South America, Australasia and parts of the Middle East and Asia.  Tunisia was the only African country that participated.  The top places in the rankings are dominated by Asian school systems - although China so far does not participate as a whole country, but is represented by high-performing cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong.  In the next set of Pisa tests it is expected that a wider range of provinces in China will be entered.  Shanghai's maths score is the equivalent of three years' schooling above the OECD average.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Changing places: Vietnam has overtaken the US and UK in education rankings  Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan are among the highest ranked across all subjects.  The OECD's Andreas Schleicher, in charge of the Pisa tests, has highlighted Vietnam's \"star performance\".  The South East Asian country has entered the top 10 for science and outperformed many much wealthier western education systems, including the United States.  ## UK slips in science  The UK has made little progress and remains among the average, middle-ranking countries, in 26th place for maths and 23rd for reading, broadly similar to three years ago.  ## READING TOP 10    * 1\\. Shanghai 570   * 2\\. Hong Kong 545   * 3\\. Singapore 542   * 4\\. Japan 538   * 5\\. South Korea 536   * 6\\. Finland 524   * 7\\. Ireland 523   * 8\\. Taiwan 523   * 9\\. Canada 523   * 10\\. Poland 518  Source: OECD  But the UK has slipped in science from 16th to 21st place.  Although not directly comparable, because there have been different numbers of countries taking part, this marks a sustained decline, with the UK having ranked 4th in the tests taken in 2000.  Much of this falling behind has been caused by other countries improving more quickly.  The OECD figures show that there has been almost no change in the UK's test scores, with the results \"flat lining\".  Within the UK, Scotland has performed slightly better than England in maths and reading, with England higher for science. Northern Ireland is behind them both across all subjects.  But the biggest gap is between Wales and the other parts of the UK, adrift from most of the middle ranking western countries.  ## Happiest pupils  The lowest ranked countries in this international league table are Peru and Indonesia. The OECD says the gap between top and bottom of this global classroom is the equivalent of six years of learning.  ## MATHS TOP 10    * 1\\. Shanghai 613   * 2\\. Singapore 573   * 3\\.

Netherlands 523  Source: OECD  However Indonesia also appears as the country where the highest proportion of children say they are happiest at school. And the least happy pupils are in high-performing South Korea.  Finland, once an education superpower at the top of the rankings, has slipped downwards. Along with Sweden, Finland had the biggest fall in scores of any country in maths tests.  Sweden has fallen behind eastern and central European countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Estonia.  But Finland still has the highest position of any European country, fifth in science, the only non-Asian country in any of the top fives.  Among the strongest performances by English-speaking countries are Ireland, ranked 7th in reading, and Canada ranked 10th in science.  Chile is the strongest performer among South American countries, above the lowest-performing European country, Albania.  ## How regions compare  These Pisa tests provide an increasing level of regional detail and they show the huge variation within a single country.  In Italy, the region of Trento is one of the best in the world at maths, but Calabria is far below many European countries, the equivalent of two years behind.  ## SCIENCE TOP 10    * 1\\. Shanghai 580   * 2\\. Hong Kong 555   * 3\\. Singapore 551   * 4\\. Japan 547   * 5\\. Finland 545   * 6\\. Estonia 541   * 7\\. South Korea 538   * 8\\. Vietnam 528   * 9\\. Poland 526   * 10\\. Canada 525  Source: OECD  The US remains average or below average, below countries such as Russia and Spain, but individual states are high performers.  If Massachusetts was ranked as a country it would be sixth best in the world, ahead of any European country.  From a low base in previous years, one of the biggest improvers in maths and reading is Qatar, a country that has been a high-profile investor in education.  Katja Hall, the chief policy director of the CBI employers' organisation, said: \"No issue matters more to the UK economy over the long term than the quality of our education system.\"  But she warned the results should be a \"wake-up call\" and that when UK schools are only \"treading water\" that the country's economic performance will suffer.  \"High-performing schools are the best way to support economic growth and greater opportunity.\"  The OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurria, launching the results in Washington in the US, said: \"It's more urgent than ever that young people learn the skills they need to succeed.  \"In a global economy, competitiveness and future job prospects will depend on what people can do with what they know. Young people are the future, so every country must do everything it can to improve its education system and the prospects of future generations.\"", "newsHeadline": "Pisa tests: UK stagnates as Shanghai tops league table - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/education-25187997", "countriesMentioned": ["China", "Finland", "French Southern Territories", "Viet Nam", "Singapore", "Indonesia", "Poland", "Sweden", "United Kingdom", "Canada", "Qatar", "Italy", "Slovakia", "Peru", "Slovenia", "Russian Federation", "Spain", "Switzerland", "Albania", "Estonia", "Tunisia", "Japan", "United States", "Russia", "Panama"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Primary school children in a classroom](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/51E0/production/_92706902_primaryschool.jpg) Image caption Northern Ireland primary pupils are are only behind students in the east Asian countries Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan  Northern Ireland has the highest-achieving primary school pupils in Europe in major international tests in maths.  They are also the sixth best at maths in the world.  They are only behind primary pupils in the East Asian countries Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.  In primary science, however, Northern Ireland ranked above average but in 27th position.  The international rankings \\- Trends in International Maths and Science Study (TIMSS) - have been published every four years since 1995.  TIMSS latest rankings are based on tests taken in 2015 by more than 580,000 students aged nine to 10 and 13 to 14 in 57 countries.  Northern Irish pupils only participate in the primary school tests, and they were also placed sixth in the world in maths in 2011.  Their global ranking of six puts them ahead of pupils in England in 10th and Ireland in 9th.  It also puts Northern Irish pupils ahead of countries like Finland and Norway which are usually high achievers.  ## The ranking means that most Northern Irish pupils can:    * Solve problems involving whole numbers, simple fractions and two-place decimals    * Understand geometric properties of shapes and angles    * Interpret and use data in tables and graphs to solve problems  The results also revealed that there was almost no difference between how girls and boys in Northern Ireland performed in either the maths or science tests.  Teachers in Northern Ireland said they spent more than 20% of classroom time teaching maths, and the study suggests Northern Ireland had one of the highest rates of computer use in the subject in the world.  The TIMSS study also suggests that pupil attendance has a significant impact on performance, with better attenders scoring higher in the tests.  ## Confident  However, global results also suggest that there is no apparent link between class sizes and level of achievement.  Other global findings from the TIMSS study suggest that pupils are more confident in maths and science in primary school than in secondary school, and that most pupils felt safe in school.  The majority of teachers were also found to be satisfied in their jobs.  Although boys and girls also performed almost equally in the science tests, Northern Ireland dropped from 21st in 2011 to 27th in 2015.  That drop in rankings was despite Northern Ireland pupils performing marginally better in the tests than in 2011.

The results of the high-stakes primary school leaving exam, which students sit aged 12, came out last week.  The test determines a child's path in the competitive school system and has become a source of stress for many.  But a call for people to share stories to show how exams don't need to decide your future has sparked an outpouring.  Over the weekend hundreds responded to Khairudin Aljunied, a local university professor who said the move would give young children \"hope and motivation\".  \"My PSLE score is 221. I am now an Associate Professor in a University,\" he wrote. Athletes, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs and a member of parliament all followed suit.  All 12-year-olds in Singapore's school system must sit the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), which gives an aggregate three-digit score across subjects. A score below 200 is widely considered poor.  But the city has also seen growing calls for a more relaxed educational environment.  Image copyright Facebook / Benjamin Kheng Image caption Mr Kheng shared a photo of himself as a child and described how his mother's death two days before the exam affected him  One popular post was by singer Benjamin Kheng who shared how he went from the \"worst kid in the worst class\" in school to the frontman of a successful rock band.  \"To every kid fearful of the road to school or back home, finding it hard to breathe, because of 3 stupid digits - the world loves you. You are deeply loved, and you are more than this,\" he said.  It also prompted a government minister to acknowledge the issue of exam stress.  Social and family development minister Tan Chuan-jin said on his Facebook page: \"I think we are on really shaky grounds if PSLE is the main determinant of our children having a happy childhood.\"  Image copyright Facebook Image caption Those who shared their stories included a nuclear pharmacist...  Image copyright Facebook/Muhd Hilwan Image caption ... the captain of Singapore's Mount Everest team...  Image copyright Facebook/ Charlotte Tan Image caption ... and a student nurse.  ## Changing attitudes  The trend is part of a growing movement over the years calling for less emphasis on academic achievements and less stress on children.  In October, a case where an 11-year-old boy jumped to his death from his high- rise flat allegedly because of exam and parental stress became a talking point in the city.  But changing attitudes remains an uphill task in a society where it is the norm for children to attend tuition classes after school, and where top exam scorers are feted, fronting advertising campaigns for health supplements.  The PSLE generates intense local press coverage with critics saying it contributes to an unhealthy pressure-cooker environment and those who defend it saying it is still the best way to test children's academic aptitude.  The government has retained the PSLE but has sought to make the school system less rigid and competitive. In 2012, it abolished the long-standing tradition of releasing the names and results of PSLE top scorers to the public.  But this has not deterred some parents - on Thursday thousands logged on to a website called Kiasuparents.com to compare their children's scores, causing the online portal to crash.  Kiasu, in the Hokkien language spoken widely in Singapore, means \"afraid to lose\".", "newsHeadline": "Singaporeans fight 'exam-shaming' by sharing scores and careers - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38126966", "countriesMentioned": ["Singapore"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "When most of us think of Arabia, we think of rolling sand dunes, scorching sun, and precious little water.

His team's findings suggest that the monsoon pushes further into Arabia every 23,000 years, allowing plants and animals to flourish. The findings are published in the journal _Geology_.  Modern humans evolved in Africa around 200,000 years ago. Later on, some of them left Africa for Europe and Asia, and from there spread all around the world.  But it is not clear when they left Africa, or what route they took.  The most widely-accepted notion is that they left around 60,000 years ago, travelling along the coastline of Arabia into southern Asia. That would mean they were stuck in Africa for 140,000 years.  Other archaeologists think they left much earlier, perhaps as much as 130,000 years ago. \"We have evidence that humans managed to expand out of Africa and into the Middle East between 130,000 and 90,000 years ago,\" says Parton. \"But a lot of people have believed that this was a dead end, this was as far as they got, because of Arabia and the deserts.\"  Parton and his colleagues have now shown that Arabia went through several periods of heavy rainfall. This would have created savannahs and woodlands, making it much more habitable. That supports the idea of an earlier migration.  Parton studied dried-up riverbeds in south-east Arabia. Found in a quarry, the Al Sibetah site preserves the silt and sediments from the bottom of the rivers, going back 160,000 years.  They found evidence of five wet phases, during which the rivers flowed and silt was deposited. During the dry times, there was little water flow and less silt was laid down.  The first wet phase happened between 160,000 and 150,000 years ago, and the most recent was around 55,000 years ago. Each was an opportunity for people to move out of Africa towards Asia.  Previous studies had suggested that rainfall increased during these periods, but it was unclear how much. In a scorching desert, a little extra rainfall doesn't make much difference. The new study suggests that the increases were big enough to support rich ecosystems.  \"The environmental record I've got fits perfectly with the archaeological record,\" says Parton. \"There was a whole series of movements of humans into Arabia.\"", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Arabia was once a lush paradise of grass and woodlands", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150223-arabia-was-once-a-lush-paradise", "countriesMentioned": ["Central African Republic", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "New Zealand"], "author": "Michael Marshall"},{"newsText": "![Images of Emad Mishko Tamo posted online](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/DA18/production/_97023855_20139979_1199686793469418_5609255471400060909_n.jpg) Image copyright Courtesy Steven Maman Image caption Images of Emad Mishko Tamo posted online  Canada says it is aware of the case of a Yazidi boy recently rescued by Iraqi forces whose mother is in Winnipeg.

The light wasn't hot and wouldn't burn anything on board. They took it to be a good omen and called it St Elmo's fire.  Atmospheric scientist Steve Ackerman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US has been fascinated by St Elmo's fire ever since his brother encountered it.  > I've still not seen it first-hand, but I'll keep looking for it  Ackerman's brother was working on some copper piping in his basement during some bad weather. \"A thunderstorm moved into the area, and at one point many of the pipes had a blue glow over them,\" says Ackerman. \"That's when I start looking into what caused it.\"  Thunderclouds create a strong electric field, because there is a strong difference in electrical charge between the cloud and the ground, which you can sometimes feel as static. The field can be intensified by pointed objects, like a metal pipe or the mast of a ship.  If this electrical field becomes strong enough, it can break air molecules down into electrically-charged particles. The gases become \"plasma\", and give off a glowing light.  A similar plasma glow can be created in the laboratory, using sharp or pointed objects to intensify an electrical field. Even so, Ackerman wants to see St Elmo's fire naturally. \"I've still not seen it first-hand, but I'll keep looking for it.\"  **Will-o'-the-wisp**  Like St Elmo's fire, the will-o'-the-wisp is a faint light that has been reported for centuries. But unlike St Elmo's fire, in recent times people have reported it less and less.  As you might expect of a phenomenon whose name has come to mean something elusive, it has never been created in the laboratory.  > It could be that the reports are fictitious  The will-o'-the-wisp is normally described as a light, flickering or constant, lying close to the ground, mostly in marshy areas of the countryside. It supposedly disappears after a couple of minutes.  Luigi Garlaschelli of the University of Pavia in Italy \u2013 best-known for recreating the Turin shroud with a few laboratory tricks \u2013 would like to study the will-o'-the-wisp in nature. But it is not clear there is anything to study.  \"The risk is indeed that we are looking for something that does not even exist,\" Garlaschelli says. \"We must trust or hope that all the sightings of will-o'-the wisps are those of a real phenomenon.\"  If will-o'-the-wisp really did represent a natural process, there are some possible explanations that Garlaschelli could test. For example, the association with marshy areas suggests that the light comes from burning marsh gas, which is mainly methane. However it is not clear what would set the gas alight.  Alternatively, it could be that the reports are fictitious; that the lights are imagined or hallucinated; or that the lights were reflections of the Moon or other lights that observers misinterpreted.  **Earthquake lights**  \"You could be standing there in the middle of the ball of light,\" says Friedemann Freund of NASA's SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, US. \"Maybe your hair would be electrified, you might have a halo like a saint. But it doesn't burn anything. You might feel a bit funny, but you wouldn't be harmed.\"  This is what it would feel like to find yourself in the middle of an earthquake light.  > The shock waves were racing through, and as the later waves arrived there was an explosion of lights  These lights are a plasma discharge that happens when a particular type of rock is under stress and builds up an electric charge, Freund says. \"We think that when we push the rocks together very fast, the charge is relieved through a plasma discharge up from the rock.\"  They can come in many different shapes, forms, and colours.  Coseismic earthquake lights, which happen during an earthquake, are bursts of light coming out of the ground over a space of a few kilometres. They rise 200-300m into the night sky in a fraction of a second, one after another.  In recent years, the abundancy of security cameras has led to beautiful videos of earthquake lights.  \"Some of the best records are in Peru,\" Freund says. \"A friend at a local university secured footage when a magnitude 8 earthquake hit the south of Lima. The shock waves were racing through, and as the later waves arrived there was an explosion of lights.\"  **Ball lightning**  Often dismissed as a myth, ball lightning turns out to be quite real.  > When an ordinary cloud-to-ground lightning bolt strikes the ground, it can vaporise certain minerals in the soil  In 2012 a team of researchers were measuring ordinary lightning in a storm- prone region of the Qinghai Plateau in China. Suddenly a ball of light about 5m across appeared in front of them. It burned white and then red for a few seconds before vanishing.  This was the first natural ball lightning to be studied. The researchers recorded the spectrum of light that the ball gave off, and analysed it to see if they could determine what this unusual lightning was made of.  It turned out to have a very earthly origin: soil. When an ordinary cloud-to- ground lightning bolt strikes the ground, it can vaporise certain minerals in the soil. Some of these contain silicon compounds, and under the extreme conditions they undergo chemical reactions to form silicon filaments.  These filaments are highly reactive, and burn with the oxygen in the air to create the orange glow that the researchers measured.  **Green flash**  In the very last seconds before the Sun sets, its light can turn bright green. But the Sun has not changed colour: the flash is caused by a mirage.  > These are the mirages that can make the Sun seem to move in shimmering waves  The atmosphere splits the Sun's white light into its separate colours, just like a prism: it bends red more than orange, orange more than yellow, and so on. Because red undergoes the strongest bending effect, it appears to fall past the horizon first, followed by orange, yellow and green.  The colours beyond green \u2013 blue, indigo, and violet \u2013 are strongly scattered by the gases in the atmosphere. That's why the sky appears blue. But as a result, the last coloured light that can be seen as the Sun falls below the horizon is green.  Normally this effect is very slight. To make the last green rays visible, there also has to be a mirage that makes the Sun appear much larger than usual. These are the mirages that can make the Sun seem to move in shimmering waves, and almost seem liquid as it pours past the horizon.  Ocean horizons often produce the best mirages for spotting a green flash.  **Upward lightning**  Perching cameras on top of the Empire State Building in New York, US in 1935, Karl McEachron of the General Electric Company recorded something strange. Lightning was travelling not from cloud to ground, but shooting up from buildings into storm clouds.  Meteorologists now know around one in a thousand lightning bolts strike upward. But despite decades of research on upward lightning, its exact mechanism is still a puzzle.  > Every time I flew through a thunderstorm, I reaffirmed that it was no place for a plane  Storm photographer Tom Warner is now researching how upward lightning is triggered, at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City, US.  His and others' research has shown that there are two distinct forms of upward lightning. Both of them require a tall structure, such as a skyscraper or wind turbine, to happen.  The first kind requires a nearby ordinary cloud-to-ground strike first. The sudden disruption to the electric field causes a \"lightning leader\", a channel of positive or negative charge, to travel up to an area of thundercloud with the opposite charge.  The second kind doesn't require a downward lightning strike nearby, and can travel upward spontaneously.  Warner has studied and photographed these rare events since becoming fascinated by an upward lightning bolt in 2004. To get his data and images, he has piloted an armour-plated plane into the hearts of storms.  \"Being able to experience storms up close and even from the inside was absolutely amazing,\" Warner says. \"It was challenging and required intense concentration. Every time I flew through a thunderstorm, I reaffirmed that it was no place for a plane.\"  **Sprites**  High above a thundercloud and its exchange of lightning with the ground, you might find a sudden reddish glow stretching for tens to hundreds of kilometres. It looks a bit like the straggling tendrils of a jellyfish.  Very large thunderstorms can produce these phenomena, which are known as sprites. \"They're very intense,\" says Martin Fullekrug of the University of Bath in the UK. \"The thunderstorm needs to produce a special kind of flash, and they're rare. Maybe only one in a thousand flashes produces a sprite.\"  > You can get a low-quality picture of a sprite with a camera of a couple of hundred pounds  These flashes need to remove a lot of electrons from the thundercloud. A long, slow current is needed to make a sprite, and such currents can form in big storm systems reaching 100km across.  The elusiveness of these deep red flashes earned them their ethereal name, adopted from Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_. But as the price of powerful cameras has dropped, sprites are being caught on camera increasingly often.  An ordinary CCTV camera with good night vision can snap a low quality image. Amateur meteor observers are also collecting extensive data on sprites.  \"You can get a low-quality picture of a sprite with a camera of a couple of hundred pounds,\" says Fullekrug. \"With a little bit of guidance anyone can do it.\"  **ELVES**  The term ELVES is a clunky acronym chosen to complement their cousins the sprites. It is short for \"Emissions of Light and Very low frequency perturbations due to Electromagnetic pulse Sources\", but that is something \"hardly any scientist can spell out for you\", according to Fullekrug.  > It is very difficult to see an ELVE with the naked eye  Appearing around 80-100km above the ground, they look very different to sprites.  \"They're expanding rings of light,\" says Fullekrug. \"They look like a doughnut from space, with a dark hole in the middle, and they spread out for 1,000km or so.\"  ELVES are fleeting, lasting for less than a millisecond. The storm conditions necessary to make an ELVE (pronounced \"elf\") include a particular type of lightning, with a very sharp rise in current. Unlike for sprites, to get an ELVE the discharge has to be very sharp, so the two rarely occur at the same time.  ELVES occur more often than sprites, with about 1 in 100 lightning flashes producing one. Small storms are just as likely to make them as big storms, as a really fast current can happen in any storm.  ELVES are mainly white because they're so intense. \"They're really, really fast,\" Fullekrug says. \"It is very difficult to see an ELVE with the naked eye. I've not seen one myself, though I've been looking quite a bit.\"  **Blue jets and gigantic jets **  \"Blue jets are a little bit of a mystery,\" says Fullekrug.  The first problem is that they're blue. Blue atmospheric phenomena are hard to study from the ground, because the atmosphere is so good at scattering blue light. They're also very narrow and rare.  > There are marvellous examples of gigantic jets developing off the coast of Africa  \"We don't know the ideal conditions for a blue jet to form,\" says Fullekrug. \"One idea is that when thunderstorms get really tall, they pierce into the thinner layers of the atmosphere above.\" Storms have powerful updrafts, which can push them above normal altitudes. \"When this happens it could generate a blue jet, but we really don't know for sure.\"  Researchers do know that there is another phenomenon called a gigantic jet, which seems to be a hybrid of a blue jet and a sprite. They are broader, wedge-shaped jets of light and easier to see. They can last 10-100ms, so they are relatively slow compared to other storm events.  \"There are marvellous examples of gigantic jets developing off the coast of Africa,\" says Fullekrug. \"But gigantic jets are rare. Perhaps only one in ten or one in a hundred sprites will combine with a blue jet to make a gigantic jet.\"  **The auroras **  The green, blue and red shapes of the auroras, swirling over the two poles of the Earth, are a visible map of events that happened thousands of kilometres away. When the solar wind \u2013 charged particles from the Sun that brush past our planet \u2013 meets the Earth's magnetic field, the two interact.  The particles from the Sun slide along the contours of the magnetic field towards the poles. When they reach the upper atmosphere, they interact with gases. The particles can give the air molecules enough energy to release electrons, causing them to glow in a range of colours.  > Earlier in 2015, Swenson launched a rocket into the aurora  \"Auroras can have many shapes and structures, depending on what the magnetosphere is doing,\" says Charles Swenson of Utah State University in Logan, US. \"There are arcs, westward surges, beading, all kinds of names for different visible shapes. You can imagine it like a sheet flapping in the wind, and every once in a while it will get really messed up and that's when these dramatic events happen.\"  Earth is not the only planet with auroras. \"All you need is a solar wind blowing past a planet that has gases on it and a magnetic field,\" says Swenson. Jupiter and Saturn both have unique auroras, as the gases of their atmospheres are very different.  The aurora also has an invisible component, which is the subject of Swenson's studies. Charged particles from the solar wind cause electrical currents in the aurora, which are hard to study from the ground. Earlier in 2015, Swenson launched a rocket into the aurora to measure these invisible elements.  \"The question is, are the invisible parts of the aurora dancing and moving as rapidly as the visible parts?\" he says. \"It's very early days, but we think the answer will be yes.\"", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Ten strange lights that appear in the sky", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150928-ten-strange-lights-that-appear-in-the-sky", "countriesMentioned": ["Central African Republic", "China", "Italy", "Peru", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Australia", "Germany", "Canada", "France", "Sweden", "Russia", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Argentina", "Brazil", "Panama"], "author": "Martha Henriques"},{"newsText": "Science calls it \"Pangaea Proxima\". You might prefer to call it the Next Big Thing. A supercontinent is on its way that incorporates all of Earth's major landmasses, meaning you could walk from Australia to Alaska, or Patagonia to Scandinavia. But it will be about 250 million years in the making.  For Christopher Scotese at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, the fact that our continents are not stationary is tantalising. How were they arranged in the past \u2013 and how will they be positioned in the future?  \"Fifty million years from now, Australia will be in collision with southeast Asia to a much larger degree,\" he says. Africa will also be pushing right up against southern Europe, while the Atlantic will be a far wider ocean than it is today.  To visualise all of these details, Scotese has produced an animation illustrating his predictions as time elapses.  However, he admits that projections for the period beyond 50 million years in the future \u2013 which include his Pangaea Proxima prediction \u2013 are \"very speculative\".  Earth's continents rest on a system of plates and these move at differing speeds. Some travel about 1.2in (30mm) per year while others might move at five times that rate. These are roughly the speeds at which human fingernails and hair grow, respectively.  These days, plate motion is tracked with satellite positioning instruments embedded into the ground. But we knew that plates moved long before such technology was invented. How? How did we ever realise that we were standing on huge, shifting plates, given that they move so slowly and are so massive?  The idea that the continents moved around dates back centuries, but the first time anyone produced any serious evidence in favour of the idea was 100 years ago. That someone was German geophysicist Alfred Wegener.  > For many geologists, continental drift was a crackpot idea with little hard evidence  He noticed remarkable similarities between the fossilised plants and animals found on continents that were separated by vast oceans. This suggested to him that those continents were connected when those now fossilised species were alive.  What's more, when Wegener looked at his maps, he could clearly see that South America and Africa were like two giant puzzle pieces \u2013 they fit together. Could that really just be coincidence, or were they connected millions of years ago, only to drift apart?  That was the essence of Wegener's theory: continental drift. But few people liked it.  In fact, for many geologists, continental drift was a crackpot idea with little hard evidence. How exactly could massive continents move?  Wegener could not provide a satisfactory explanation. He died in 1930. But his idea lived on, and 20 years later, his vindication would begin.  > South America and Africa were like two giant puzzle pieces \u2013 they fit together  The crucial secrets that would unlock the truth of his theory were not to be found on those moving continents. They were all hidden under the sea.  Marie Tharp was one of the first people to realise that mountain ranges and huge valleys were not just features found on land, but under the oceans as well. In the early 1950s Tharp helped to map a gigantic submarine mountain range, thousands of kilometres long but only a few kilometres wide, zigzagging right down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  Similar ranges lie beneath the waves of other oceans. They have since been named \"mid-ocean ridges\" \u2013 and their discovery helped turn the tide of thought on how the Earth's surface had formed.  Harry Hess, an American geologist and submarine commander in World War Two, recognised the potential significance of the mid-ocean ridges.  > This sideways movement of rock... could ultimately explain why the continents themselves moved  During the war, Hess had used sonar to map some areas of the ocean floor in detail. He had found it to be far from the flat, featureless landscape most geologists had assumed it to be.  The discovery of mid-ocean ridges fit with an idea he was developing \u2013 namely that the ocean floor is constantly, but very slowly, renewing itself. He suggested that hot magma welled up along the mid-ocean ridges and cooled into rock. Then, as more hot magma welled up at the ridge, the cool rock was pushed down the ridge flanks to make room.  This sideways movement of rock, perpendicular to the mid-ocean ridges, could ultimately explain why the continents themselves moved. They were being pushed around by the upwelling of magma along the mid-ocean ridges.  His theory became known as \"seafloor spreading\". But still, other geologists were sceptical. Other features under the sea were providing more clues, though, and gradually turning the tide of opinion in Hess's favour.  > It was, simply, the best evidence yet of a driving force that could shift continents  Many rocks on Earth contain magnetic minerals. Before these rocks solidified from magma, those minerals could spin around like tiny compass needles and align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field. Upon cooling, the \"compass needles\" became frozen in place.  Canadian geologist Lawrence Morley and British geologists Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews realised that this alignment process provided more evidence for seafloor spreading.  Every so often the Earth's magnetic field flips: our compass needles would point towards Antarctica rather than the Arctic. That flipping process showed up in the rocks that make up the very fabric of the seabed. It was \"striped\", laid out in bars of normal and reverse polarity that lay parallel to the mid- ocean ridge.  The best way to explain this was through seafloor spreading.  > The plates are like little bits of crust on top of the soup  The magnetic minerals in hot lava at a mid-ocean ridge are aligned to the Earth's magnetic field, and then frozen when the lava cools. As rock is formed and then moves down the flanks and away from the ridge, it preserves a record of the changes in Earth's magnetic field over tens of thousands of years. The study of these records is called \"palaeomagnetism\".  The idea also explained why the stripes on each side of the ridge were generally exact mirror images of each other. Rock usually trundles away from both sides of the mid-ocean ridge at the same rate.  It was, simply, the best evidence yet of a driving force that could shift continents. Geologists now accept that Hess \u2013 and Wegener before him \u2013 were right to envisage Earth's geography as constantly in motion.  \"It's like a big soup cauldron,\" says Susan Hough, a seismologist at the US Geological Survey in California. \"The plates are like little bits of crust on top of the soup.\"  > The plates are in a kind of eternal war, fighting for position on the face of the Earth  There are two layers in the Earth's crust and upper mantle that are described by this metaphor. The lithosphere \u2013 the hard, cooler part of the crust, including the plates themselves \u2013 and the asthenosphere, where molten rock moves up towards the lithosphere and sometimes breaks through at the mid-ocean ridges.  The ground under your feet is not as rock-solid as you might have thought. All of this convection and mechanical activity drives the motion of plates. They can bump into each other, slide past or shift away from each other. Some plates can even become buried, or \"subducted\", under neighbouring plates, \"recycling\" their rock back to the Earth's interior.  The plates are in a kind of eternal war, fighting for position on the face of the Earth.  We know that the plates have moved, but how can we actually plot their positions back through time? Scotese has produced animations showing what we believe to be the movements of the continents over the last 750 million years.  \"It's sort of like a CSI investigation,\" he says. \"You have to use all the evidence you can to tell the story because there's no eyewitnesses, there's no video cameras taking pictures.\"  > Fossils of Mesosaurus are found, not just in South America, but Africa as well  Despite the challenge, Scotese says we can get 70 million years into the past with a good degree of confidence. That's because we can track the progress made by seafloor spreading quite accurately to work out where the continents used to be. But there are also different types of geological records that let us see even further back.  Scotese gives the example of ancient fossil coral reefs. Between 300 and 400 million years ago, what is now North Africa was crossing from polar to tropical latitudes.  \"If you look carefully, you can see exactly when it crossed that boundary from being in the cold half of the hemisphere to the warm half,\" explains Scotese. \"So coral reefs appear for the first time [in this region] and begin to grow on these carbonate platforms.\"  Indeed, the fossil record is a hugely significant area of evidence. This, of course, was what initially gave Wegener confidence in his ideas.  > When Mesosaurus was alive, it was possible to walk between almost any two points on any two continents  Take the example of _Mesosaurus_, a creature not dissimilar from today's crocodiles. It was a freshwater reptile with a long, powerful jaw, which lived between 270 and 300 million years.  Here is the weird part. Fossils of _Mesosaurus_ are found, not just in South America, but Africa as well. It was a freshwater animal and could never have swum across the Atlantic Ocean to develop colonies on both continents. How did its fossils end up on either side of that vast ocean, then?  The answer is simple: 300 million years ago, there was no Atlantic. Those two continents were joined, and _Mesosaurus_ never had to swim that distance.  In fact, when _Mesosaurus_ was alive it was possible to walk between almost any two points on any two continents. All the landmasses were united in the supercontinent Pangaea \u2013 which is something Scotese expects to happen again about 250 million years from now when his \"Pangaea Proxima\" supercontinent forms.  The existence of the ancient Pangaea is recorded in the distribution of other fossils. _Lystrosaurus_, for example, was a giant herbivore. Its fossil remains are now found in Africa, India and even Antarctica.  > Beyond 300 million years ago, the ancient magnetic record becomes much more patchy  Even the plant _Glossopteris_, a woody shrub that grew to 98ft (30m) in height, helps to confirm the idea that at one stage all of today's continents were jammed together as Pangaea.  Fossil evidence of _Glossopteris_ has been discovered in South America, Africa, India, Antarctica and Australia. Importantly, the seeds of the plant were massive and could not have floated or been blown on the wind to other land masses. A supercontinent, on which the seeds could be dispersed via land, is thought to be the only credible explanation.  However, all these forms of evidence have their limitations. Beyond 300 million years ago, the ancient magnetic record becomes much more patchy, so it is difficult to find hard evidence of continental movements. And at 500 million years, says Scotese, the fossil record also becomes less detailed.  As for predicting what will happen in the future, Scotese does this first of all by looking at how the plates are moving today and then extrapolating that movement over time. This is the simplest way to develop a prediction. But, he adds, after many millions of years, there is no telling what geological events might cause unforeseen changes to that movement.  > Plate tectonics give us valleys and huge mountain ranges, earthquakes and continental boundaries  \"In the plate tectonic world, plates do evolve slow and steady until we have one of these plate tectonic catastrophes like continental collisions,\" he says. \"This fundamentally changes plate tectonic regimes.\"  Various statistical models help to provide a range of options for how the continents will be arranged more than 100 million years from now. But that is so far in the future, it is not clear to anyone how accurate these are.  Still, it is fun to speculate, and it helps reinforce the reality that the Earth is an active, dynamic planet \u2013 the very face of which keeps changing. Plate tectonics give us valleys and huge mountain ranges, earthquakes and continental boundaries. And there are still mysteries about how they work.  Hough points out that we are still investigating exactly why the Tibetan plateau, which lies north of the Himalayas, is as high as it is.  Plus, our knowledge of plate tectonics on other planets is incredibly limited. Indeed, we have only recently found some evidence that suggests tectonics on Mars and Jupiter's moon, Europa.  > The continents really did move \u2013 and they have not stopped yet  \"You get into some interesting questions,\" says Hough. \"Like, is it a coincidence that we live on a tectonically-active planet, or was that somehow important for the emergence of life?\"  For now we can only wonder. But plate tectonics have undoubtedly been significant for the development and dispersal of life on Earth. The secrets of the shifting ground beneath our feet have largely been revealed \u2013 and mostly within the last 50 years.

Mr Duterte said insurgents had beheaded a policeman on the southern island. At least three other members of the security forces are reported dead.  On Tuesday he imposed martial law on Mindanao, where Muslim separatists and other rebels are fighting the army.  Some of the groups have pledged support for so-called Islamic State (IS).  Thousands of people have been fleeing fighting in the city of Marawi after gunmen rampaged through the city.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Security forces have been patrolling streets on Mindanao after the declaration of martial law  \"I will not hesitate to do anything and everything to protect and preserve the Filipino nation,\" the president said. \"I might declare martial law throughout the country to protect the people.\"  President Duterte said the police chief of Malabang on Mindanao had been stopped on his way home \"at a checkpoint manned by terrorists and I think they decapitated them right there and then\".  As he imposed 60 days of martial law on the island on Tuesday, he warned he would be harsh in dealing with terrorism.  \"If it takes a year to do it, then we'll do it. If it's over within a month, then I would be happy,\" he said in a video posted online by the government.  Image copyright AFP Image caption President Duterte's talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had to be brought forward  Mr Duterte cut short his visit to Russia to deal with the violence.  During his talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he also said the Philippines needed more modern weapons to fight IS militants and other militant groups.  Martial law allows the use of the military to enforce order and the detention of people without charge for long periods.  The Philippine constitution says a president can only declare martial law for 60 days to stop an invasion or a rebellion.  * * *  ## Who are the Maute group? - BBC Monitoring    * Also known as IS Ranao, the group is based in Mindanao's Lanao del Sur province   * Formed in 2012 by Abdullah Maute (aka Abu Hasan) and his brother Omar   * Ranks are believed to comprise a few hundred fighters, mostly from other armed Islamist groups   * The group's first known encounter with the military came in 2013, when it attacked a security checkpoint in Mindanao   * Pledged allegiance to IS in 2015   * In February 2016, troops overran the group's Butig headquarters, killing around 40 rebels   * The group has also been linked with Isnilon Hapilon, a prominent figure in the Abu Sayyaf militant group  * * *  Parliament can revoke the measure within 48 hours while the Supreme Court can review its legality.  This is only the second time martial law has been declared since the fall in 1986 of President Ferdinand Marcos.  ## Deep-rooted conflict  The violence in Marawi, a city of about 200,000 people in Mindanao, erupted on Tuesday as the army searched for the leader of a militant group that had pledged allegiance to IS, the military said.  Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana identified the militants as members of the Maute group. They had occupied a hospital and a jail, and burnt down buildings including a church, he added.  Marawi is about 800km (500 miles) south of the capital Manila.  Mr Duterte had promised that finding a lasting peace on the island would be a top priority for his administration.  But the conflict is complex and deep-rooted, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports.

In November, Syrian government forces launched a renewed assault, and rapidly retook almost all of the opposition-held east. By mid-December they had pushed the rebels into just a few neighbourhoods.  Tens of thousands of civilians fled those districts. The UN said it had received allegations that hundreds of men had gone missing since crossing into government-controlled areas - and that rebels prevented some civilians from leaving.  On 15 December, the warring sides reached an agreement to end the fighting, and on 22 December the government declared it had taken full control of the city following days of evacuations.  * * *  ## Why did both sides agree to a ceasefire deal?  The rebels had been rapidly pushed back into a small enclave, where, along with thousands of civilians, they came under intense bombing. The deal was negotiated between one of the rebels' key backers, Turkey, and Syria's ally Russia.  It follows a pattern of similar, local ceasefire and evacuation deals which have ended fighting in other besieged rebel-held parts of Syria, such as the Old City of Homs in 2014 and the Damascus suburb of Daraya this August.  Under the terms of the Aleppo deal, rebels and civilians were allowed to be evacuated to rebel-held Idlib province, while civilians in the rebel-besieged mainly Shia villages of Foua and Kefraya in Idlib were allowed to leave in return - at the insistence of Iran, sponsor of pro-government Shia Muslim militias fighting in Aleppo.  ## Why is Aleppo important?  Aleppo was once Syria's largest city, with a population of about 2.3 million. It was also the country's industrial and financial centre.  The old city is a Unesco World Heritage site and was famous for its 13th Century citadel, 12th Century Great Mosque and huge covered markets, or souks.  ![A general view taken with a drone shows Aleppo's historic citadel as seen from a rebel-held area of Aleppo, Syria, 12 October 2016](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/142E3/production/_92695628_b9960fec-5516 -4f5e-84ab-7172b1bed885.jpg) Image copyright Reuters Image caption Aleppo's Old City, a Unesco World Heritage site, has been devastated by years of fierce fighting  When the uprising against President Assad erupted in 2011, Aleppo did not see the large protests or the deadly violence that shook other towns and cities.  But it suddenly became a battleground in July 2012.  Rebel fighters launched an offensive to kick out government forces and gain control over northern Syria but the rebel assault was not decisive.  ![Aleppo souk before and after showing the market has been completely destroyed](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/CC84/production/_92865325_souk_beforeandafter.jpg) Image copyright AFP Image caption Much of Aleppo's ancient souk in the Old City has been damaged or destroyed  ![Mosque before and after](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5754/production/_92865322_mosque_beforeandafter.jpg) Image copyright Alamy and Reuters Image caption The minaret of Aleppo's Great Mosque (top right) was toppled in early 2013  Aleppo ended up divided roughly in half - the opposition in control of the east, and the government the west.  Over the next four years, the battle for Aleppo became a microcosm of the wider conflict in Syria.  It highlighted the weakness of both sides, as well as the failure of the international community to protect civilians and broker a peace agreement.  * * *  ## Who has been fighting?  On the government side, state forces are being supported by Russian air strikes and Shia militias, including fighters from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Pakistan.  The predominantly Sunni Muslim opposition is made of several rebel groups, many of whom have received financial aid from key opponents of President Assad, including the US, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  Hardline Sunni Islamist groups are involved too, most notably Jabhat Fateh al- Sham, which earlier this year changed its name from the Nusra Front and announced it was cutting ties with al-Qaeda.  ![Field hospital which Russia says was destroyed by a rebel attack](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/111A/production/_92987340_mediaitem92987339.jpg) Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia says a mortar attack on 5 December wrecked its field hospital in west Aleppo  * * *  ## How the rebels have lost ground in 2016  **4 Jan: **At the start of the year, the rebels hold eastern Aleppo, linked to the border with Turkey via territory to the north and west. Turkey's government is a key backer of the rebellion against Mr Assad.  **27 Jul: **At the end of July, government forces surround the rebels, taking control of the strategically-important Castello Road in northern Aleppo, the only route into the rebel-held east. About 275,000 people suddenly find themselves under siege.  **Early Aug: **Rebels and al-Qaeda-linked jihadist fighters in the countryside outside Aleppo seize back control of a route through the Ramousseh district in the south of the city linking them up with the outside world again.  **Mid-Oct: **Government forces retake the area in early September and resume the siege. There is a brief pause in the offensive in mid-October to allow civilians and rebels to leave, but few take up the offer.  **28 Nov:** Syrian government forces recapture more than a third of rebel-held territory in eastern Aleppo. The rebels lose all of the northern neighbourhoods, leaving them with under two-thirds of the territory they had in the city.  **6 Dec:** Troops advance further, seizing more districts in the east. The gains mean the government has now recaptured more than 70% of the rebel-held area.  **12 Dec: **The Syrian army makes more gains, taking several districts, including the key Sheikh Saeed area, from the rebels, leaving them confined to a small enclave.  **13 Dec**: Following intense bombardment from pro-government forces, the rebels are squeezed into ever smaller areas of the city, retreating into just a handful of neighbourhoods.  **15 Dec: **A ceasefire deal is reached. Buses begin to take fighters, their families, and wounded people from east Aleppo to rebel-held areas in Idlib province. More buses are sent to evacuate residents of two villages, Foah and Kefraya, besieged by rebels in north-western Syria, as demanded by the government after an attempted deal the previous day collapsed.  **22 Dec: **Government declares full control over Aleppo for the first time in four years.  * * *  ## Syrian government forces launch their final push  ![Forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hold up a Syrian flag as they walk through a recaptured military complex in Aleppo \\(5 September 2016\\)](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D6AF/production/_92695945_1a387b43-d472-4eae-9697-e64095049b1f.jpg) Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Syrian government launched an all- out assault on the rebel-held east in September  After the government resumed its air campaign on 15 November, troops pushed into several northern Aleppo districts and forced rebels and jihadists to retreat southwards. Tens of thousands of civilians fled their homes.  By 13 December, more than 90% of the city had fallen to the government. The UN warned up to 100,000 people were trapped in \"ever-shrinking\" areas of eastern Aleppo, adding that rebels were stopping people from leaving.  Food and fuel in the rebel-held areas were running out, and basic infrastructure and health care facilities had been obliterated - at one point in November, all hospitals in eastern Aleppo were virtually out of action as a result of air strikes.  ![A man eats food that was distributed as aid in a rebel-held, besieged area in Aleppo, Syria \\(6 November 2016\\)](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D19B/production/_92695635_7a3bda04 -ec7c-41f2-a13b-bc07426bab1f.jpg) Image copyright Reuters Image caption The last UN food rations in eastern Aleppo were distributed in mid-November  The UN says hundreds of civilians died, but the government and Russia denied targeting them.

But with rebel forces, jihadist groups and Kurds still controlling large parts of the country, there would still be a long way to go.  So there is a possibility that it may become a different type of war - with rebels not trying to hold territory and create their own entity but instead pursuing a hit-and-run insurgency.  ## Territory control across Syria and Iraq  .", "newsHeadline": "What's happening in Aleppo? - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38132163", "countriesMentioned": ["Turkey", "Iran, Islamic Republic of", "Russian Federation", "Iraq", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Lebanon", "United States", "Syria"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Rodrigo Duterte kisses a Philippines flag in Manila \\(7 May 2016\\)](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1321C/production/_89646387_89646386.jpg) Image copyright Reuters  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has attracted intense controversy for a bloody drug war and undiplomatic remarks since he took office in June 2016.  The straight-talking leader won by a landslide on the back of promises to tackle crime and corruption, and remains popular domestically for his hardline policies.  But he has increasingly earned criticism from the international community and rights groups that say his policies amount to human rights abuses.  ## 'Slaughter' of addicts  The hallmark of Mr Duterte's administration so far has been a relentless crackdown on drug dealers and users.  He has urged citizens and the police to conduct extra-judicial killings of suspects. More than 3,000 people have died in a campaign which Mr Duterte controversially compared to the Holocaust in September.  Noting that there are three million addicts in Philippines, he has said he would be \"happy to slaughter them\".

Domestic activist groups have also protested the killings.  Image copyright AP Image caption The war on drugs has attracted protests from local student and activist groups  But Mr Duterte has said a hardline stance was necessary to wipe out the illegal drugs trade and remains undeterred, vowing to kill \"every last one\" of the traffickers.  The police has said the campaign has worked in reducing overall crime, with hundreds of thousands of suspects turning themselves in - although homicides and murders have gone up.  ## 'Son of a whore'  Faced with mounting criticism, Mr Duterte, known for making brash off-the-cuff remarks, has been bellicose.  He has threatened to \"separate\" from the UN \\- which he later said was a joke - and called UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon \"a fool\".  He also called the EU \"hypocrites\" during a September speech and showed the middle finger.  He famously referred to US President Barack Obama as a \"son of a whore\", but later expressed regret when Mr Obama cancelled a meeting.  Earlier he called the Pope \"the son of a whore\" in a largely devout Catholic country, and joked that when he was still the mayor of the southern city of Davao he should have been the first to rape an Australian missionary murdered in a prison riot.

His father was once a provincial governor and the family had links with the powerful families in Cebu province, where his father was once mayor.  Mr Duterte trained as a lawyer and rose to become state prosecutor, eventually becoming mayor of Davao in 1988, ruling the city for much of the past 30 years.  He built his reputation fighting some of the biggest problems facing the Philippines - crime, militancy and corruption. All three dropped significantly during his time leading Davao, making the city one of the safest in the Philippines.  He has vowed to replicate his efforts in Davao at a national level.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Duterte supporters say his tough reputation is what the Philippines needs to deal with corruption and crime  ## Pivoting to China?  Self-styled as both a socialist and a reformist, he has promised to change the country from a centralised system to a federal parliamentary form of government, to better share wealth.  His foreign policy direction, vague during campaigning, has continued to flip- flop.  Mr Duterte had previously hinted at taking a stronger stance against China, which the Philippines is engaged with in maritime disputes in the South China Sea. He famously said he would ride a jet ski to a disputed island claimed by both countries and stick a flag on it.  But since becoming president he has emphasised a desire to move away from the US - the Philippines' former colonial ruler turned military and economic partner - and pivot closer to China and Russia, sparking concerns from investors.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Duterte's firebrand speeches have done little to dent levels of support among Filipinos hungry for change  ## 'Duterte Harry'  His tough approach has earned him the nicknames \"The Punisher\" and \"Duterte Harry\". He said in a televised debate that he would kill his own children if they took drugs.  All have burnished his strongman image among many in the Philippines as someone who will do what is necessary to get things done. A July poll saw him earning a historic 91% approval rating.  But horrified opponents have continued to castigate him, comparing him to US presidential Republican nominee Donald Trump. Mr Duterte has rejected the comparisons, saying that \"he is a bigot and I am not\".  Married twice, he has four children, one of whom - daughter Sara - took over as mayor for a term before he resumed office. He is now officially single, but has claimed to have several girlfriends.", "newsHeadline": "Profile: Duterte the controversial 'strongman' of the Philippines - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-36659258", "countriesMentioned": ["China", "Russian Federation", "United States", "Russia", "Japan"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "On the campus of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, some trees buzz more than others \u2013 which is exactly what behavioural ecologist Francisca Segers had hoped for.  She approaches one buzzing tree. There is a short wax tube extending from a hole in the trunk. Hovering around the opening are half a dozen small yellow- and-brown bees, the source of the gentle buzz.  Next, Segers reaches into a box she is carrying and takes out a tiny black lump. It is the crushed head of a robber bee (_Lestrimelitta limao_), freshly killed that morning. She gingerly places the robber bee head on the tube opening, and watches as it slowly rolls down the tube into the tree.  In an instant, a cloud of the tiny yellow-and-brown bees bursts from the tube. \"It was just six bees flying at the entrance\u2026 then suddenly there were two hundred,\" says Segers.  These are no ordinary bees, though. Colonies of _Tetragonisca angustula_, known locally as \"Jatai bees\", are particularly adept at seeing off enemies. That is because Jatai bees, uniquely, have developed a soldier caste.  Christoph Gr\u00fcter at the University of Mainz and his colleagues first announced in 2012 that Jatai bees have soldiers. Their suggestion stirred up quite a buzz.  > Jatai bees, uniquely, have developed a soldier caste  Of course, we already know that a number of other social animals have evolved a soldier caste: ants, termites, and even some less socially-complex animals like aphids, snapping shrimps and flatworms. Yet until Gr\u00fcter and his colleagues made their announcement, nobody had found bee soldiers. That fed a general assumption that bees cannot evolve such a class.  One reason why Jatai soldiers went unnoticed for so long is because of the diminutive size of this particular bee.  \"It is very difficult to spot the size differences in Jatai bees because they are so small,\" says Martin Kaercher, who examined the defensive behaviours of Jatai guards for his PhD at the University of Sussex. \"I had also not expected size differences in bees.\"  Kaercher was not alone. Over the years, many researchers have examined the 5mm-long Jatai bees up close, without noticing that certain individuals are subtly, but consistently, larger. Size differences at such scale are almost impossible to spot; at least, without very good vision. Fortunately, Gr\u00fcter's colleague, Cristiano Menezes at the University of Sao Paulo has an eye for detail.  \"We were running a study where we introduced workers from one Jatai bee colony to the nest entrance of another,\" says Gr\u00fcter. \"Eventually, Cristiano noticed that the guards seemed larger than the workers we introduced.\"  > Robber bees are pirates on wings  Meticulous measurement of more than 300 bees confirmed Menezes's observation: Jatai bees guarding the entrance are 30% heavier than the rest. They also have larger hind legs.  \"I was amazed and delighted [to know of Jatai bee soldiers], since we only knew about caste differences in ants and termites,\" says Kaercher of Gr\u00fcter's 2012 discovery.  Why might Jatai bees have developed a class of soldiers while other bees apparently have not?  There is no definitive answer, but clues might come from Segers's experiments with the decapitated heads of robber bees. Because it turns out that robber bees pose a very real threat to Jatai colonies.  Robber bees are pirates on wings. They plunder the colonies of other bees \u2013 like the Jatai \u2013 and raid their stores.  If one robber bee encounters a Jatai colony and returns to its own colony to recruit more robbers for an attack, the result can be devastating, says Segers. \"We have lost colonies to robber bees.\"  > The much larger robber bee usually succeeds in killing the Jatai soldier, often decapitating it in the process  This is why it is in the Jatai bees' best interests to attack a robber scout before it can relay its message. As Segers's experiment shows, the mere whiff of a robber bee's presence is enough to alert the Jatai soldiers. They rush out of the nest and charge at the intruder, flying close enough to lock on to the robber bee with their powerful jaws.  \"Ideally, the Jatai bee grabs the wings of the robber bee and doesn't let go,\" says Gr\u00fcter, who has witnessed many such fights. Both bees fall out of the sky, the robber grounded by the soldier. They grapple with each other as the robber bee tries to tear away its tenacious attacker.  Eventually, the much larger robber bee usually succeeds in killing the Jatai soldier, often decapitating it in the process. But the dead bee's relentless jaws clamp on to its killer, preventing the robber from flying away.  \"The Jatai bees commit suicidal defence, lying on the ground with the robber bee until maybe an ant comes along and [takes] them away,\" says Gr\u00fcter.  Jatai soldiers hover around the nest, expanding the defence perimeter and intercepting robber bee scouts before they reach the colony. In addition, Jatai bees seal their nests at night, and use wax and resin on complex nest tunnels to entangle enemies.  > Jatai bee soldiers are quite unlike any other animal soldiers we know  It is a surprisingly comprehensive system, which Gr\u00fcter has described as \"one of the most sophisticated defences among social bees\".  \"I've read that Jatai bees and robber bees overlap greatly in their distribution,\" says Gr\u00fcter. \"If so, this would mean a long history of co- evolution and arms race between the bees.\"  Recently, however, Gr\u00fcter and his colleagues reported that Jatai bee soldiers are quite unlike any other animal soldiers we know.  While ant or termite soldiers do little else but fight enemies, Jatai bee soldiers also partake in civilian duties. They build and clean the nest, nurse the larvae and dry the wax.  > What we see in Jatai bee soldiers is counterintuitive  Even more surprising is that in the first half of their month-long lives, Jatai bee soldiers outwork the workers. On average, each Jatai bee soldier performs ten different behaviours to the worker's eight, and each soldier does between 30 and 40% more work than the workers. Most of this work involved nest maintenance.  \"We do not know of any other case where soldiers show more diverse behaviours than workers,\" says Gr\u00fcter. \"In ants, soldiers are specialists that work very little and have a relatively narrow set of behaviours.  \"What we see in Jatai bee soldiers is counterintuitive. It goes against the theory of caste evolution that increasing specialisation leads to narrowing behaviour sets.\"  > Maybe there are developmental limits that make it impossible for Jatai bees to evolve extreme soldier types  For now, Gr\u00fcter and his colleagues can only speculate why Jatai bee soldiers are so versatile and hard-working.  Perhaps Jatai bees have evolved their specialised soldier caste far more recently than other social animals, so the soldiers have not yet evolved to focus all their efforts on fighting.  Or perhaps Jatai soldiers can work like workers do because they are not starkly different in size and shape. The soldiers in colonies of army ants or leafcutter ants dwarf the worker ants like tigers to cats. Jatai soldiers, in contrast, stand next to Jatai workers like horses to donkeys.  \"Maybe there are developmental limits that make it impossible for Jatai bees to evolve extreme soldier types,\" Gr\u00fcter says.  Those limits might be set by the design of their nests.  All Jatai bees are born in rigid cells of brood combs in the hive centre. Worker bees regurgitate food into each cell, the queen adds an egg, and the worker seals the cell. The egg hatches and the larva eats the provisioned food, developing in the cell until it emerges as an adult.  > Soldiers are really just hard-working workers until they reach the entrance  Segers found that Jatai soldiers are reared in specific cells right in the centre of the brood. There the cells are a little larger and receive more food, giving rise to larger and heavier bees. But the size difference is still constrained by the need for the cells in the brood combs to tessellate.  In contrast, ant and termite larvae grow in open space and are fed continuously by their carers, which allows individuals destined to be soldiers to grow much larger.  Scientists call the larger Jatai bees \"majors\" and the rest of the smaller workers \"minors\". Jatai bee majors make up less than 6% of the workers. Most end up as soldiers.  But that does not happen until the end of their lives.  Newly-emerged majors and minors alike start work in the brood, deep in the hive. As the workers age, they move further from the hive's centre and switch occupations, dealing with waste, wax and resin. At this stage, majors work a lot more and have a couple more tasks in their repertoire than minors.  > The soldiers in colonies of army ants or leafcutter ants dwarf the worker ants like tigers to cats  But by the third week of their short lives, when their workplace moves to the periphery of the hive, minors and majors wear completely different uniforms. Minors forage for food while majors guard the hive, most becoming the soldiers that Gr\u00fcter and Segers study.  \"In a way, soldiers are really just hard-working workers until they reach the entrance,\" says Gr\u00fcter. \"It makes sense to call them majors, and refer to them as soldiers only when they pick up the defence at the end of their lives.\"  Majors seem to be an asset to the hive. They outwork minors early in their life, and then later they help defend the hive. But they make up less than one-tenth of the workforce of the hive. So why does a Jatai bee colony not produce more majors?  For one thing, majors are expensive. A juvenile major eats 20% more food than a juvenile minor, and as adults they likely eat more food too. Yet majors do not collect food for the nest.  > It appears that Jatai bees can tune their production of majors and minors according to their needs  Furthermore, Jatai bee majors may work more than minors, but nobody has compared their efficiency. \"If majors are less efficient, they might not be worth the extra cost,\" says Gr\u00fcter.  For a better sense of the value a Jatai colony places on its majors, we simply have to look at the way colonies respond to limited food and threats. In one experiment, Segers moved Jatai bee colonies into areas where competition for food was intense. Five months later, the colonies had adapted by producing smaller soldiers \u2013 but minors remained the same size.  In areas where enemy robber bees are rare, meanwhile, Jatai bee colonies deploy fewer soldiers. But when scientists jack up the threat for several weeks, or give the impression of a greater threat by rolling robber bee heads into the nest, Jatai bee colonies build up their army of soldiers.  In other words, it appears that Jatai bees can tune their production of majors and minors according to their needs. Majors \u2013 soldiers \u2013 are valued most when robber bees are lurking.  This makes sense to Paul Cunningham, an insect behavioural ecologist at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who has documented a four-month-long war between Australian stingless bees. He thinks that enemies play a key role in shaping the evolution of a defence system.  \"If your enemy are larger bees and you are more likely to overpower them with individual strength, then having strong soldiers is an advantage,\" says Cunningham. \"This is the case with Jatai bees against robber bees.\"  > Perhaps other bees have also evolved hard-working soldiers that juggle many tasks  On the other hand, if both sides are similarly matched in strength, then the colony with the most workers wins. \"Having stronger fighters isn't always the best strategy.\"  Next, Gr\u00fcter and his team will scrutinise other bee species for soldiers. If they discover soldiers in other bees, they could better understand how species of bees evolve soldiers.  The diverse behaviours of Jatai bee soldiers \"draw a big question mark\", says Gr\u00fcter. \"[It's] not just about the evolution of soldiers in this species but also in general about the evolution of physical caste in social insects.\"  Perhaps other bees have also evolved hard-working soldiers that juggle many tasks. But that is not going to bother the Jatai bees \u2013 they are concerned only with robber bees and honey. As new cohorts of Jatai bee majors emerge from brood cells, they will live as all of the previous generations of soldiers did: work harder than the rest and die guarding the nest.  _Join over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram._  _If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

When you see the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, in Mosul announcing the creation of a caliphate - an Islamic state ruled by a religious leader - it's easy to think that what you're watching is a march back into the past. The horrifying savagery with which the jihadist organisation treats anyone that stands in its way seems to come from a bygone era. The fact that Isis - the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, which has now changed its name to the Islamic State - claims that it wants to restore an early type of Islam, leads many of us to see it as trying to bring about a reversion to mediaeval values.  To my mind, this gives too much credence to the way Isis views itself. There's actually little in common between the horribly repressive regime it has established in parts of Iraq and Syria and the subtle Islamic states of mediaeval times, which in Spain, for example, exercised a degree of tolerance at a time when the rest of Europe was wracked by persecution. Destroying ancient shrines and mosques, Isis is trying to eradicate every trace of Islamic tradition. It's probably even more oppressive than the Taliban were in Afghanistan. In power, Isis resembles a 20th Century totalitarian state more than any type of traditional rule.  Surprising as it may sound, Isis is in many respects thoroughly modern. Like al-Qaeda before them, these jihadists have organised themselves as a highly efficient company. Initially funded by donations from wealthy supporters, they've rapidly expanded into a self-financing business. Through kidnapping and extortion, looting and selling antiquities, siphoning off oil in territories they conquer, seizing gold bullion and other assets from banks and acquiring large quantities of American military hardware in the course of their advance, Isis has become the wealthiest jihadist organisation in the world. According to some estimates, it's worth well over $2bn.  Isis uses this wealth to expand its popular base, providing public services and repairing damaged infrastructure in the areas it controls. Its use of social media is highly professional. On its websites it issues annual reports containing detailed accounts of its acquisitions and operations, including breakdowns of the bombings, assassinations and suicide missions it has carried out.  Isis makes effective use of the internet to broadcast the brutal manner with which it deals with anyone judged to be an enemy. Isis's savagery isn't impulsive. Everything suggests it's a strategy developed over a number of years. When it posts videos of people being beheaded or shot, Isis advances several of its goals - simultaneously inspiring dread in its enemies, teaching the communities it controls the dire consequences of departing from an exceptionally extreme interpretation of Islam and sowing chaos in the population as a whole. There's nothing mediaeval about this mix of ruthless business enterprise, well-publicised savagery and transnational organised crime. Dedicated to building a new society from scratch, Isis has more in common with modern revolutionary movements.  Image copyright AFP PHOTO/HO/AL-FURQAN MEDIA Image caption Abu Bakr Al- Baghdadi, pictured speaking in Mosul  Though al-Baghdadi constantly invokes the early history of Islam, the society he envisions has no precedent in history. It's much more like the impossible state of utopian harmony that western revolutionaries have projected into the future. Some of the thinkers who developed radical Islamist ideas are known to have been influenced by European anarchism and communism, especially by the idea that society can be reshaped by a merciless revolutionary vanguard using systematic violence. The French Jacobins and Lenin's Bolsheviks, the Khmer Rouge and the Red Guards all used terror as a way of cleansing humanity of what they regarded as moral corruption.  Isis shares more with this modern revolutionary tradition than any ancient form of Islamic rule. Though they'd hate to hear it, these violent jihadists owe the way they organise themselves and their utopian goals to the modern West. And it's not just ideas and methods that Isis has taken from the West. Western military intervention gave Isis its chance of power. While Saddam was in charge, there were no jihadist movements operating in Iraq - none at all. With all the crimes Saddam's dictatorship committed, it was a regime that applied secular law and had made some steps towards emancipating women.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Islamist fighters in the Syrian province of Raqqa celebrate the declaration of the caliphate  In my view, toppling Saddam was bound to unravel this secular state and the Iraqi state itself. Even if the American-led occupiers hadn't made the mistake of disbanding the army and dissolving the ruling party, the country would eventually have broken up. Iraq was constructed from provinces of the former Ottoman Empire by the British in the 1920s, with the Sunni minority being the ruling group. The Sunnis had ruled since 1638, when the Ottomans took Baghdad from the Persians. The Kurds, who were included in the new state because the British prized the oil resources in the north of the country, were sure to take any opportunity to seize independence. Whatever the failings of the Maliki government, the idea that a stable federal system could develop in these circumstances has always been far-fetched. As some of those who opposed the war from the start foresaw, regime change created many of the conditions for a failed state. These are the same conditions that have allowed Isis to emerge and thrive.  It's sometimes suggested that ideology played no real part in the invasion of Iraq - grabbing the country's oil was what it was all about. No doubt geopolitical calculation played a part, but I think an idea of what it means to be modern was more important. The politicians and opinion-formers who clamoured for the invasion believed that all modern societies are evolving towards a single form of government - the type that exists in western countries. If only tyranny was swept away in Iraq, the country would move towards democracy and the rest of the Middle East would follow. Until just a few months ago, some were convinced that a similar process could take place in Syria.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US tanks on Iraq border, 2003: \"Regime change created many of the conditions for a failed state\"  As I see it, this has never been more than an ideological fantasy. The modern world isn't evolving in any single direction. Liberal democracy is only one of several possible destinations. With its delusional ambitions (which, if we are to believe recent statements, include reconquering Spain) Isis illustrates a darker aspect of the modern world - the practice of using terror and violence in an attempt to achieve impossible goals.  Isis may have already over-reached itself. It's facing determined opposition from many sides - not just from Shia militias but also rival Sunni jihadists such as Al Qaeda, from which it's an offshoot. There are conflicting interests among the disparate elements Isis has recently recruited, and it's not clear that it can govern a state on any long-term basis. Moreover, Baghdadi's claim to speak for all Muslims is dismissed by Islamic scholars and rejected as absurd by practically the entire Muslim world. Even so, Isis poses a real danger - and not just in the Middle East.  ## Caliphate  Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Statue of Suleiman the Magnificent, Istanbul    * Name given to Islamic state led by supreme religious and political leader known as caliph, or successor to the Prophet Muhammad   * Succession of Muslim empires described as \"caliphates\"; most famous is Ottoman caliphate or empire (1453-1924)   * Centring on power of Turkish sultans, Ottoman Caliphate expanded to cover the Balkans and Hungary under Suleiman the Magnicient in 16th Century, and reached gates of Vienna   * Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk abolished Ottoman Caliphate in 1924 and exiled the last caliph, Abdulmecid  It's hard for anyone to estimate in precise terms the scale of the threat Isis poses to countries such as Britain. Its main targets are in the Middle East. Still, there must be a danger that Western citizens who have gone to Syria and Iraq as Isis fighters will return battle-hardened and with new bomb-making skills. Also, Isis has now declared war not only on the west but also on al- Qaeda. In these circumstances there may be an increased risk that one or other of these groups will be tempted to stage a spectacular act of terror in order to secure a position of leadership in the global jihadist struggle.  Through their policies of regime change, Western governments have pursued an ideological vision that leaves out the dark side of the modern world. In doing so, they've unwittingly let loose a particularly nasty version of modern savagery. Whatever happens to the self-styled caliphate, the forces it embodies aren't going to fade away. Isis is a part of the revolutionary turmoil of modern times, and until we grasp that uncomfortable fact we won't be able to deal with the dangers we face.  _A Point of View is broadcast on Fridays on Radio 4 at 20:50 BST and repeated Sundays 08:50 BST- _or listen on BBC iPlayer  _Subscribe to the _BBC News Magazine's email newsletter_ to get articles sent to your inbox._", "newsHeadline": "A Point of View: Isis and what it means to be modern - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28246732", "countriesMentioned": ["Iraq", "Afghanistan", "Spain", "United Kingdom", "Hungary", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "A bumblebee flies up to inspect a flower, looking for a taste of nectar. It buzzes around a bit and realises that something is different. The bee can see the flower but cannot reach it.  That is because the \"flower\" \u2013 actually a blue plastic disc with sugar water in the centre \u2013 is sitting underneath a sheet of transparent plastic. Luckily for the bee, there is a string attached to the flower. All it has to do is pull on the string, haul out the flower, and sip its reward. So it does.  \"When we first started the string-pulling experiments, it was almost a joke,\" says Lars Chittka of the Queen Mary University of London in the UK. \"I laughed my head off when I first saw it. It just looked very funny.\"  But there is more. Once one bee figured out what it needed to do to access the artificial flower, other bees that were looking on learned the string-tugging trick themselves. The technique even outlasted the original successful bee. It became part of the colony's skillset, transmitted from bee to bee after the first string-pulling bee had died.  \"I just couldn't believe what I was seeing,\" says Chittka.  Bees, it turns out, can solve problems, learn from each other, and pass down that knowledge through generations.  > Chittka's lab did an experiment in the 1990s in which they asked whether bees can count. They can  Yet learning to pull on a string is just the latest thing that we now know bees can do. The incredible capacity for learning amongst bees and other social insects has been documented since Victorian times.  Charles Darwin himself suggested that learning could happen across species. He noted that honeybees might learn from watching bumblebees extract nectar in a novel way.  Bees can also learn to recognise colours and patterns. Can they find their way back home from several kilometres away? Not a problem. Recognise human faces? That too. Can bees use tools? Well, that is what Chittka wants to answer next.  Chittka's lab did an experiment in the 1990s in which they asked whether bees can count. They can.  \"At that point, we began to scratch our heads a little bit,\" Chittka says. \"How much cleverness can you stick into a tiny brain?\"  > Bees fly up to 10km away from their hive, through a landscape cluttered with trees and other landmarks  Many people might assume that sophisticated behaviour begins with a large brain. After all, humans have unusually large brains \u2013 containing about 86 billion neurons \u2013 and we are also an astonishingly clever species. The two characteristics must be linked.  But the more scientists learn about the behaviour of insects and other small animals, the clearer it becomes that complicated skills do not necessarily require a big brain.  \"How far can we push these little brains to do surprising things?\" asks Chittka. \"And should we be as surprised as we are that little-brained creatures can solve these puzzles?\"  It now seems that the answer to the latter question is no: we should not be surprised.  For instance, dragonflies zip through the air, catching mosquitoes, moths, butterflies and even other dragonflies.  It is a harder task than appearances might suggest. Each different prey species has a unique flight pattern. The dragonfly has to watch how its prey is flying, predict its likely trajectory, and then move to try to intercept it mid-flight. This requires behavioural flexibility and planning.  > Researchers have even worked out exactly which individual neurons are responsible for the formation of this memory  Meanwhile, bees fly up to 10km away from their hive, through a landscape cluttered with trees and other landmarks. They have to find the best flowers with the greatest pay-off of nectar, and remember their locations. They also have to avoid predators and make it back home again, where they then communicate with other bees in intricate social interactions.  These creatures have complex worlds, and need the cognitive capacity to survive in them.  Even a simple nematode worm, an animal less than 1mm long and with only 302 neurons in its entire nervous system, is capable of basic learning and memory. Newly-hatched nematodes that encounter toxin-emitting _Escherichia coli_ bacteria remember to avoid the microbes for the rest of their four-day lifespans.  Researchers have even worked out exactly which individual neurons are responsible for the formation of this memory and for retrieving it later on.  If such minute brains are capable of these cognitive tasks, how exactly do they do it? To understand this, we need to get down to the level of the individual neurons and the circuits they form.  Neurons act a little like wires, carrying electrical signals from one part of the brain to another. They are a biological version of the circuit board in a computer.  > There are powerful research tools that allow Vivek to selectively switch on or off different parts of the brain  Studying this circuitry is key to understanding cognition, and it is easier to do in small brains with hundreds or thousands of neurons than in large brains with billions. Tiny brains have to pack the maximum computational power into a small space, so they have evolved minimal wiring solutions.  Vivek Jayaraman, at the Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia, studies fruit flies. With 250,000 neurons, fruit fly brains are about a quarter of the size of a bee's.  \"The brain has to solve computational problems in order for behaviour to unfold,\" explains Vivek. \"And complex behaviour involves solving a bunch of these problems.\"  Vivek, an engineer by training, wants to understand the mechanics underlying the behaviour. How does the brain do cognition? For this, he needs to see what the neurons are doing as the behaviour unfolds.  > Vivek and his colleagues showed that fruit flies have a sort of mind's eye  But can we step into the brain of a fruit fly and listen in to what they are thinking? Well, sort of. There are powerful research tools that allow Vivek to selectively switch on or off different parts of the brain, then watch as neurons activate in real time.  For instance, one measure of cognition is being able to keep track of where you are in space \u2013 an internal representation of the world around you. Having an internal representation means that if the lights suddenly go out in the room you are in, you still know which direction you are facing, where the door is, and how to get to the kitchen where you have a flashlight in the drawer.  You are able to maintain awareness of your body position relative to objects in the room and how to move around within that space. Think of this as your mind's eye.  In 2015, Vivek and his colleagues showed that fruit flies have a similar sort of mind's eye.  The scientists used a technique that allows them to see individual fly neurons turning on and off in real time as the insect navigates through a virtual reality world.  > This little insect... essentially has a picture in its head of where it is  The fruit fly walks on a tiny treadmill \u2013 actually a ball that rotates as the fly walks forward, stops, or moves in any direction. At the same time a screen surrounds the treadmill, like a fly version of an Imax movie, onto which the researchers project lights.  As the fly walks around on the ball, the lights on the screen move in response, as if the fly were moving around in the real world. So if the fly turns to the left, its world on the screen correspondingly moves to the right.  The researchers are able to watch as different parts of the fly's brain become active as the fly navigates this world. Then they turn off the lights. Just as in humans, the fly brain continues to respond as if the lights are on even after they are switched off. It maintains an internal representation of its surroundings.  Cognitive representations like this were previously thought to be the sole domain of backboned animals like us, but that might not be the case.  > With just a few hundred or thousand neurons, you can easily recognise perhaps a hundred faces  \"The fact that this little insect can sit in the darkness, and essentially has a picture in its head of where it is, is pretty remarkable,\" Vivek says.  The next step is to find out if this internal representation is flexible. If your roommate tells you that he has moved the flashlight from the kitchen to the bedroom, your internal representation must change to accommodate this new information.  \"That for me is a kind of building block of cognition,\" Vivek says. \"The ability to plan based on an internal representation and a memory, rather than just responding to what we see right now.\"  Can the fruit flies do something similar even with their tiny brains? We may know before too long.  \"There is a general perception,\" says Chittka, \"that because we are big- brained, in order to do clever things you need to have very big brains. But that's not actually the case.\"  For instance, the ability to recognise faces, which was once thought to be a uniquely human ability, turns out to require a relatively simple neural circuitry \u2013 which probably explains how bees can carry out the task.  > There are some things that a bigger brain might allow, but some of them might be fairly boring  \"With just a few hundred or thousand neurons, you can easily recognise perhaps a hundred faces,\" he says.  So why bother having a bigger brain?  One reason why large animals have larger brains may simply be that the electrical signals have to travel longer distances. For the signal to travel at a reasonable speed, you need larger neurons, which can carry signals faster than small neurons. So a whale has a large brain with big neurons because a signal has a long way to travel from one end of its body to the other.  Or maybe it is not the whole brain that needs to be bigger, but just one part of it. For instance, animals that have large home ranges, or cache food in thousands of places like a Clark's nutcracker, tend to have a relatively large hippocampus \u2013 the part of the brain involved in memory. They can remember more things than bees.  \"In that case,\" says Chittka, \"the increase in capacity might be just one of storage size \u2013 just as you might have a computer with a bigger hard drive but not necessarily a better processor. There are some things that a bigger brain might allow, but some of them might be fairly boring.\"  Bigger brains might just replicate the same circuits over and over, giving you more of the same behaviour \u2013 greater storage capacity, better acuity, more detail, precision, and finer resolution of responses \u2013 but not necessarily new computations or layers of complexity.  Chittka points out that sometimes, bigger brains certainly do mean more complexity \u2013 as in the case of our brains, for instance \u2013 but it is not automatically the case.  > I think understanding at a basic level will take a long time, but I'm in a hurry  Humans tend to be a little defensive about their complex, big brains. Vivek says that people often say to him, \"wait, you get paid to work with fruit flies?\" They want to know what this can teach us about human cognition.  \"People think that it's cool or cute,\" he says. \"But it's more work to explain why it's important and what you can learn.\"  The message of his work is actually straightforward: if you want to learn how something complex works, start by studying something simple.  In this case \"simple\" is a relative term, because neurons and their connections are anything but simple. \"But at least numerically, there are fewer neurons [in the fruit fly brain], it's compact, I can see a bunch of them at the same time,\" says Vivek. \"And I have the tools to manipulate them and tinker with the different parts at will.\"  Because of this, he is able to address mechanistic questions that cannot yet be answered in bigger brains.  \"I don't by any means think that this is the very end of how cognition is done,\" says Vivek. Instead, he thinks the relatively simple circuits he is studying are building blocks of cognition. \"I think understanding at a basic level will take a long time, but I'm in a hurry \u2013 I want the answers in my lifetime!\"  > Bigger brains might just replicate the same circuits over and over, giving you more of the same behaviour  Chittka also sometimes laments the obsession with finding human-like abilities in other animals. \"I find that a bit tedious and too narrow,\" he says.  The sensory abilities that insects have but humans do not \u2013 like sensitivity to ultraviolet, infrared, or polarised light, or an internal magnetic compass for navigating \u2013 are captivating on their own. Perhaps we could let go of looking at cognition in terms of human abilities.  \"One of the very reasons I find insects fascinating is because they're so weird, so different, so non-human-like,\" Chittka says.

They make up the fourth- largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state.  In recent decades, Kurds have increasingly influenced regional developments, fighting for autonomy in Turkey and playing prominent roles in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where they have resisted the advance of the so-called Islamic State (IS) jihadist group.  ## Where do they come from?  The Kurds are one of the indigenous people of the Mesopotamian plains and the highlands in what are now south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Syria, northern Iraq, north-western Iran and south-western Armenia.  Today, they form a distinctive community, united through race, culture and language, even though they have no standard dialect. They also adhere to a number of different religions and creeds, although the majority are Sunni Muslims.  Kurdistan: A State of Uncertainty  * * *  ## Why don't they have a state?  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Despite their long history, the Kurds have never achieved a permanent nation state  In the early 20th Century, many Kurds began to consider the creation of a homeland - generally referred to as \"Kurdistan\". After World War One and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Western allies made provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres.  Such hopes were dashed three years later, however, when the Treaty of Lausanne, which set the boundaries of modern Turkey, made no provision for a Kurdish state and left Kurds with minority status in their respective countries. Over the next 80 years, any move by Kurds to set up an independent state was brutally quashed.  Aiming to change the outcome of World War One  * * *  ## Why are Kurds at the forefront of the fight against IS?  Image copyright AFP Image caption Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been fighting Islamic State in northern Iraq  In mid-2013, IS turned its sights on three Kurdish enclaves that bordered its territory in northern Syria. It launched repeated attacks that until mid-2014 were repelled by the Popular Protection Units (YPG) - the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Unity Party (PYD). The turning point was an offensive in Iraq in June 2014 that saw IS overrun the northern city of Mosul, routing Iraqi army divisions and seizing weaponry later moved to Syria.  The jihadists' advance in Iraq also drew that country's Kurds into the conflict. The government of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region sent its Peshmerga forces to areas abandoned by the army.  For a time there were only minor clashes between IS and the Peshmerga, but in August 2014 the jihadists launched a shock offensive. The Peshmerga withdrew in disarray, allowing several towns inhabited by religious minorities to fall, notably Sinjar, where IS militants killed or captured thousands of Yazidis.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Turkish military personnel did not intervene in the battle for Kobane  Alarmed by the IS advance and the threat of genocide against the Yazidis fleeing Sinjar, a US-led multinational coalition launched air strikes in northern Iraq and sent military advisers to help the Peshmerga. The YPG and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), previously active in Turkey, also came to their aid.  Although the IS advance on Kurdish territory in Iraq was eventually halted by the Peshmerga and their allies, it did not stop trying to capture the Kurdish enclaves in Syria. In mid-September 2014, IS launched an assault on the enclave around the northern town of Kobane, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee across the nearby Turkish border.  Despite the proximity of the fighting and the threat posed by IS, Turkey refused to attack the jihadist group's positions near the border or allow Turkish Kurds to cross to defend it, triggering Kurdish protests. In October, Ankara partially relented and agreed to allow Peshmerga fighters to join the battle for Kobane, after US-led air strikes helped halt the IS advance.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption The YPG has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition battle against IS  In January 2015, after a battle that left at least 1,600 people dead and more than 3,200 buildings destroyed or damaged, Kurdish forces regained control of Kobane.  Since then, the Kurds have inflicted a series of defeats on IS in northern Syria with the help of US-led coalition airpower. They have established control over a 400km (250-mile) stretch of contiguous territory along the Turkish border and advanced to within 50km (30 miles) of the IS stronghold of Raqqa.  Fighting under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the YPG has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition, which considers it one of the few effective partners on the ground in Syria.

Kurds received harsh treatment at the hands of the Turkish authorities for generations. In response to uprisings in the 1920s and 1930s, many Kurds were resettled, Kurdish names and costumes were banned, the use of the Kurdish language was restricted and even the existence of a Kurdish ethnic identity was denied, with people designated \"Mountain Turks\".  In 1978, Abdullah Ocalan established the PKK, which called for an independent state within Turkey. Six years later, the group began an armed struggle. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.  Image copyright AFP Image caption More than 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched an armed struggle in 1984  In the 1990s the PKK rolled back on its demand for independence, calling instead for greater cultural and political autonomy, but continued to fight. In 2012, the government and PKK began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed, although clashes continued.  The ceasefire collapsed in July 2015, days after a suicide bombing blamed on IS killed 33 young activists in the mainly Kurdish town of Suruc, near the Syrian border. The PKK responded by attacking Turkish soldiers and police, and the Turkish government launched what it called a \"synchronised war on terror\" against the PKK and IS. Since then, hundreds of people have been killed in clashes in south-eastern Turkey and in air strikes on PKK camps in northern Iraq.

Turkey's government says the YPG and the PYD are affiliates of the PKK, share its goal of secession through armed struggle, and are all terrorist organisations.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The Democratic Unity Party (PYD) is the dominant force in Syria's Kurdish regions  Kurds make up between 7% and 10% of Syria's population. Before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011 most lived in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, and in three, non-contiguous areas around Kobane, the north-western town of Afrin, and the north-eastern city of Qamishli.  Syria's Kurds have long been suppressed and denied basic rights. Some 300,000 have been denied citizenship since the 1960s, and Kurdish land has been confiscated and redistributed to Arabs in an attempt to \"Arabize\" Kurdish regions. The state has also sought to limit Kurdish demands for greater autonomy by cracking down on protests and arresting political leaders.  The Kurdish enclaves were relatively unscathed by the first two years of the Syrian conflict. The main Kurdish parties publicly avoided taking sides. In mid-2012, government forces withdrew to concentrate on fighting the rebels elsewhere, after which Kurdish groups took control.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption YPG fighters have clashed with Syrian rebels, but are focused on battling IS  The Democratic Unity Party (PYD) quickly established itself as the dominant force, straining relations with smaller parties who formed the Kurdistan National Council (KNC). In January 2014, they united to declare the creation of a democratic autonomous government, with branches based in the three Kurdish enclaves. The parties stressed that they were not seeking independence from Syria but \"local democratic administration\" within a federal framework.  PYD leader Salih Muslim has insisted that any political settlement to end the conflict in Syria will have to include legal guarantees for Kurdish rights and recognition of Kurdish autonomy. Mr Muslim has also denied that his party is allied to the Syrian government, even though the YPG has fought against some rebel groups and avoided conflict with the army, stressing that President Assad cannot remain in power after any transitional period.

Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption A peace deal agreed by the KDP and Iraq's government in 1970 collapsed four years later  Kurds make up an estimated 15% to 20% of Iraq's population. They have historically enjoyed more national rights than Kurds living in neighbouring states, but also faced brutal repression.  Kurds in the north of Iraq revolted against British rule during the mandate era, but were crushed. In 1946, Mustafa Barzani formed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to fight for autonomy in Iraq. After the 1958 revolution, a new constitution recognised Kurdish nationality. But Barzani's plan for self-rule was rejected by the Arab-led central government and the KDP launched an armed struggle in 1961.  In 1970, the government offered a deal to end the fighting that gave the Kurds a de facto autonomous region. But it ultimately collapsed and fighting resumed in 1974. A year later, divisions within the KDP saw Jalal Talabani leave and form the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).  Image copyright AFP Image caption Some 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled into Iran and Turkey after the 1991 rebellion was crushed  In the late 1970s, the government began settling Arabs in areas with Kurdish majorities, particularly around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, and forcibly relocating Kurds. The policy was accelerated in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq War, in which the Kurds backed the Islamic republic. In 1988, Saddam Hussein unleashed a campaign of vengeance on the Kurds that included the poison-gas attack on Halabja.  When Iraq was defeated in the 1991 Gulf War Barzani's son, Massoud, led a Kurdish rebellion. Its violent suppression prompted the US and its allies to impose a no-fly zone in the north that allowed Kurds to enjoy self-rule. The KDP and PUK agreed to share power, but tensions rose and a four-year internal conflict erupted in 1994.  The two parties co-operated with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein and have participated in all national governments formed since then. They have also governed in coalition in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), created in 2005 to administer the three provinces of Dohuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya, and sought to maximise Kurdish autonomy by building a pipeline to Turkey and exporting oil independently.

In February 2016, Massoud Barzani - who became president of Kurdistan in 2005 - reiterated the call for a referendum. However, he stressed that it would be non-binding and would simply allow Kurdish leaders to \"execute the will of the people at the appropriate time and conditions\".

The question asks readers to guess the birthday of a girl called Cheryl using the minimal clues she gives to her friends, Albert and Bernard.  Cheryl's Birthday was initially reported to be an examination question for 11 -year-olds.  Students stressed by tough examinations is a perennial issue here, and Cheryl's Birthday reignited concerns that the education system was too challenging.  Image copyright facebook  But it later emerged it was for students aged about 15 taking part in last week's Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (Sasmo).  Organisers said the test was aimed at the top 40% and aimed to \"sift out the better students\", adding it was \"important to clarify so that Singapore parents will not start to worry so much\".

But if these kind of problems can be used to stretch the better students to sharpen their analytical power, why not?\"  The question, which has been shared around the world, sparked a Twitter hashtag #cherylsbirthday and even a music track.  \"After spending so much time together, thinking of Cheryl's birthdate, Albert and Bernard soon fell in love with each other and forgot all about Cheryl,\" said Elfy Bianca Hassan on Mr Kong's page.  \"Dump her.

Nicholas Ong, who graduated from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), one of Singapore's top schools, said that \"kids who grow up in Singapore start running the rat race from an early age\".  \"My parents did not place many academic demands on me, but there was always a subliminal pressure from society to get good grades.\"  One teacher at a junior college in Singapore, who didn't want to give their name, told the BBC the ad could encourage \"a new narrative amongst Singaporeans about education, that the process is just as important as the outcome\".  \"I think MOE is heading in the right direction to acknowledge, and even to some point, affirm various life routes beyond one that focuses on grades.

The Shia-led governments that have held power since then have struggled to maintain order, and the country has enjoyed only brief periods of respite from high levels of sectarian violence.  Violence and sabotage hinder the revival of an economy shattered by decades of conflict and sanctions. Iraq has the world's third largest reserves of crude oil.  ## FACTS  ##  Republic of Iraq  ###  Capital: Baghdad    * Population 33.7 million     * Area 438,317 sq km (169,235 sq miles)     * Major languages Arabic, Kurdish     * Major religion Islam     * Life expectancy 68 years (men), 73 years (women)     * Currency Iraqi dinar   UN, World Bank  Getty Images  ## LEADERS  **President: Fuad Masum**  Image copyright Getty Images  Veteran Iraqi politician Fuad Masum was overwhelmingly elected by parliament in July 2014.  He is the second ethnic Kurdish president of Iraq, succeeding Jalal Talabani.  **Prime Minister: Haider al-Abadi**  Image copyright Getty Images  A veteran politician from the Shia State of Law party, Mr al-Abadi was deputy speaker of parliament when President Masum asked him to form a government in the summer of 2014.  Mr al-Abadi heads a cabinet with Sunni and Kurdish support, something which the previous government lacked.  Improved relations between the central government and the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government made possible the signing of a deal in December 2014 on sharing Iraq's oil wealth and military resources.  It was hoped this would help build the consensus needed to enable the country to face the common threat represented by the armed Islamic State group, which by the end of 2014 had advanced into northern and central Iraq.  However, his administration has been dogged by accusations of corruption and the charge that the allocation of posts according to sectarian quotas takes precedence over competence.  ## MEDIA  Image copyright Getty Images  There are hundreds of publications and scores of radio and TV stations.

The first and second places are taken by Finland and South Korea.  The rankings combine international test results and data such as graduation rates between 2006 and 2010.  Sir Michael Barber, Pearson's chief education adviser, says successful countries give teachers a high status and have a \"culture\" of education.  International comparisons in education have become increasingly significant - and this latest league table is based upon a series of global test results combined with measures of education systems, such as how many people go on to university.  This composite picture puts the UK in a stronger position than the influential Pisa tests from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - which is also one of the tests included in this ranking.  The weightings for the rankings have been produced for Pearson by the Economist Intelligence Unit.  ## Global competition  The two education superpowers - Finland and South Korea - are followed by three other high-performing Asian education systems - Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.  ## EDUCATION TOP 20    * Finland   * South Korea   * Hong Kong   * Japan   * Singapore   * UK   * Netherlands   * New Zealand   * Switzerland   * Canada   * Ireland   * Denmark   * Australia   * Poland   * Germany   * Belgium   * USA   * Hungary   * Slovakia   * Russia  The UK - which is considered as a single system, rather than four devolved administrations - is then ranked at the head of an above-average group including the Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland.  These are ahead of a middle-ranking group including the United States, Germany and France.  At the lowest end are Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia.  These comparisons draw upon tests that are taken every three or four years, in areas such as maths, science and literacy - and so present a picture lagging by several years.  But the intention is to provide a more multi-dimensional view of educational achievement - and create a databank which will be updated, in a project that Pearson is calling the Learning Curve.  Looking at education systems that succeed, the study concludes that spending is important, but not as much as having a culture that is supportive of learning.  It says that spending is easier to measure, but the more complex impact of a society's attitude to education can make a big difference.  The success of Asian countries in these rankings reflects the high value attached to education and the expectations of parents. This can continue to be a factor when families migrate to other countries, says the report accompanying the rankings.  Looking at the two top countries - Finland and South Korea - the report says that there are many big differences, but the common factor is a shared social belief in the importance of education and its \"underlying moral purpose\".  ## Teacher quality  The report also emphasises the importance of high-quality teachers and the need to find ways to recruit the best staff. This might be about status and professional respect as well as levels of pay.  The rankings show that there is no clear link between higher relative pay and higher performance.  And there are direct economic consequences of high and low performing education systems, the study says, particularly in a globalised, skill-based economy.  But there are less straightforward and conflicting messages about how schools are organised.  The ranking for levels of school choice shows that Finland and South Korea have among the lowest levels of school choice. But Singapore, another high performer, has the highest level. The UK is among the upper levels in terms of school choice.  ## 'Significant' data  Higher levels of school autonomy are a characteristic of many higher performing systems - headed by China, the Netherlands, the UK and Hong Kong (which is considered as a separate school system in such education rankings).  But Finland, the most successful system, has a relatively low level of school autonomy.  Sir Michael Barber, a former adviser to Tony Blair, said that the gathering of this information was the \"start of something significant\" - providing a practical resource for policy makers wanting to learn from other countries.  In terms of the UK's performance, he said it fitted into the view that education standards had risen at the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000s and had then levelled off.  Labour's education spokesman Stephen Twigg said the findings reflected the achievements of the previous government.  \"This report shows that after 13 years of investment and reform with Labour, schools in the UK are amongst the best in the world.\"  And he said the findings did not provide evidence for the current government's support for free schools.  \"This shows there is much more to school performance than structures,\" said Mr Twigg.  A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We are driving up standards right across the board by bringing the best graduates into teaching, developing a world-class curriculum, and restoring order to our classrooms.  \"We are driving forward the academies and free schools programmes with more than half of secondary schools now enjoying academy status.  \"We have introduced the EBacc so more pupils are encouraged to study the core academic subjects that universities and employers demand and we will be introducing a new, far more rigorous examination system.\"", "newsHeadline": "UK education sixth in global ranking - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/education-20498356", "countriesMentioned": ["Finland", "Singapore", "Canada", "Brazil", "Indonesia", "Mexico", "France", "United Kingdom", "China", "Japan", "United States", "Russia"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Stephen Hawking](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C1FF/production/_88636694_031871171.jpg) Image copyright PA Image caption Stephen Hawking (left) as a pupil at at St Albans School in Hertfordshire in the 1950s  Scientist Stephen Hawking has paid tribute to the teacher who inspired his early steps into scholarship.

Geologists have suspected this happens for some time. Now a study of ancient rocks reveals that they really were once heated to these unimaginable temperatures.  Mountains form when rocks are forced upwards. But before this happens, the rocks that will make up the mountains first melt, over many millions of years.  In effect, these forming mountains have roots, \"rather like icebergs floating in the sea\", says Simon Redfern at the University of Cambridge in the UK, who was not involved in the new study. \"If you build up a mountain it needs to have an equivalent amount of mountain root at its base.\"  Now a new study, published in _Earth and Planetary Science Letters_, gives the strongest evidence yet that the temperature in these deep parts of the Earth's crust can exceed 1000C.  A team of geologists studied samples of mountainous rock from the Eastern Ghats in east India. They tried to figure out how hot the rocks had once been.  When the Eastern Ghats were forming, the rocks would have been about 30km down. There they would have been subjected to such intense heat and pressure that they were partially liquid.  The higher the temperatures got, the more liquid rock leaked out by rising to shallower levels of the crust. These rocks then cooled and solidified into the mountains.  This would have happened many times with continuing rises in temperature, says co-author Michael Brown of the University of Maryland in College Park.  This process of melting and cooling changed the minerals in the rocks, leaving clues to how hot they were.  According to Redfern, knowing the temperatures of rocks will help us understand how planets work.  That could prove useful. Some rocks are more likely to break and fracture like glass, leading to violent earthquakes. Knowing the temperatures rocks have been exposed to should help us understand this, says Redfern.  Understanding mountain formation could also help us find deposits of valuable minerals, such as those containing rare metals, which ultimately come from deep inside the Earth.  \"Most of the economically important elements we have become concentrated in the crust,\" says Brown. \"The more we understand how everything works, the more likely we are able to make predictions of where to find these resources in the future.\"  \"Ultimately, this influences the distribution of resources as well as the distribution of natural hazards,\" says Redfern.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Rocks get super-heated to 1000C under new mountains", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141120-the-hottest-part-of-earths-crust", "countriesMentioned": ["British Indian Ocean Territory", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "Australia"], "author": "Melissa Hogenboom"},{"newsText": "The Earth's magnetic field, which protects us from potentially dangerous solar radiation, is gradually losing its stability. No need to move underground or build space colonies just yet, though: the changes are taking place over millions of years.  You might assume that compasses will always point north, but in fact the magnetic poles have swapped places many times in the Earth's history. Earth scientists have long suspected that these flips are becoming more frequent, and that the magnetic field was less prone to pole reversals in the distant past.  Now the most detailed analysis of the geological evidence to date suggests that the field really is slowly destabilising. Whereas in the distant past it reversed direction every 5 million years, it now does so every 200,000 years.  Earth's magnetic field is powered by the heart of the planet. At its centre is a solid inner core surrounded by a fluid outer core, which is hotter at the bottom. Hot iron rises within the outer core, then cools and sinks. These convection currents, combined with the rotation of the Earth, are thought to generate a \"geodynamo\" that powers the magnetic field.  > The last major reversal was 781,000 years ago  Because of changing temperatures and fluid flows, the strength of the magnetic field varies, and the positions of the north and south magnetic poles shift.  These shifts leave traces in rocks. When lava cools, metal oxide particles within the rock become frozen in the direction of the prevailing magnetic field. So scientists can work out the historic positions of the magnetic poles by examining and dating lava samples.  As a result we know there have been about 170 magnetic pole reversals during the last 100 million years, and that the last major reversal was 781,000 years ago.  So are these reversals becoming more or less common? In theory, it depends on what is happening to Earth's core.  Researchers believe the inner core is slowly growing, as the outer core cools and solidifies. That should mean more frequent flips. Simulations by Gary Glatzmaier of the University of California, Santa Cruz and his colleagues, suggest that a bigger inner core would be more of an obstruction to currents in the outer core, making for a more unstable magnetic field.  But it is hard to verify this, because in older rocks the evidence of magnetic field direction is less well preserved. So Toni Veikkolainen of the University of Helsinki in Finland, assembled a swathe of existing data from rock samples between 500 million and 3 billion years old.  First, Veikkolainen weeded out all the less reliable data. For example, he rejected all samples containing hematite, because it can form a long time after the rest of the rock, leading to muddled data. He also left out slow- cooling rocks like granite, and threw out samples that were known to have tilted, unless they could be accurately corrected based on other evidence.  Having whittled down around 300 data sets to 55, Veikkolainen estimated how frequently magnetic pole reversals occurred at different points in Earth's past.  > The evidence points to a more stable field in the very far past and fewer reversals  He found that reversals happened about once every 3.7 million years between 500 million and 1.5 billion years ago. But in an earlier time, between 1.5 billion and 2.9 billion years ago, the magnetic field only flipped once every 5 million years.  That is much less often than in the last 150 million years, when the field has flipped every 600,000 years. In the last 10-20 million years it has sped up even more, to once every 200,000-250,000 years.  \"The evidence points to a more stable field in the very far past and fewer reversals,\" says Veikkolainen.  \"This looks to me to be the most thorough study that has been done so far, and it does reinforce many of the conclusions of earlier work, so I think it's pretty good evidence,\" says Robert Coe of the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Are we due for another flip? It's hard to say.  Data collected by the European Space Agency's Swarm satellite array reveals the Earth's magnetic field has recently been weakening at a rate of around five per cent per decade. The field does change all the time, but a rate of five per cent century is more normal, leading some to speculate a pole reversal may be imminent.  It is unclear precisely what would happen if the field weakens greatly or disappears for a time during a reversal. However, scientists believe power grids and communications systems are potentially at risk.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Earths magnetic field now flips more often than ever", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141110-earths-magnetic-field-flips-more", "countriesMentioned": ["Finland", "United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Nic Fleming"},{"newsText": "The world's largest ever blue sapphire has been unveiled, discovered in Sri Lanka's Ratnapura mines.  It weighs an astonishing 1404.49 carats, equivalent to about 280g (just under 10 ounces). Local gemologists say they have never seen a larger sapphire.  It is a type of gem known as a \"star sapphire\", due to the six-pointed star within the gem. This occurs because of the way light reflects from crystals trapped within it.  Its anonymous owner spoke to the BBC\u00a0and\u00a0suggests it could sell for up to $175m.  BBC Earth spoke to mineral scientist Simon Redfern from the University of Cambridge in the UK, to find out how such enormous gems can form.  Making sapphires is a lengthy process. This particular sapphire would have formed within the rocks of Sri Lanka's highlands.  > The temperatures and pressures would have changed only very slowly over millions and millions of years  The rocks are mostly granites, which form when molten magma cools and solidifies. But they have been subjected to intense heat and pressure.  \"The granites have been dated as almost two billion years old, and were subsequently squeezed and re-worked in a massive metamorphic mountain-building episode that happened more than 500 million years ago,\" says Redfern. \"Temperatures and pressures deep within the roots of these mountains would have reached more than 900C and over 9000 atmospheres pressure.\"  The sapphire could have formed within the granite itself before it was re- worked, or later when the rocks were being heated and squeezed.  \"In either case, the temperatures and pressures would have changed only very slowly over millions and millions of years,\" says Redfern. \"This is how the crystal was able to grow so big.\"  After the gem formed, it sat within the rocks while they were uplifted into mountains, which were then eroded. \"And so it was brought to the surface, picked out of the rock by the forces of rain and weathering, and transported down river to the gem sands of Ratnapura,\" says Redfern.  > The granites have been dated as almost two billion years old  Minerals such as sapphire can only survive journeys like this because they are so hard. Other, softer rocks would have eroded into mud and sand, helped along Sri Lanka's river beds by the country's heavy rainfall.  Sapphires are so hard because they are formed from corundum, an aluminium oxide. \"Corundum is the hard gritty stuff used as an abrasive in emery paper,\" says Redfern.  \"If you add just a trace of iron and titanium to the mixture of aluminum and oxygen from which the corundum is growing, it forms as sapphire.

It turns out that the mass of the Earth is 5.9 sextillion tonnes: that's 59 followed by 20 zeroes.  There's no sign of anything that massive at the surface.  \"The density of the material at the Earth's surface is much lower than the average density of the whole Earth, so that tells us there's something much denser,\" says Redfern. \"That's the first thing.\"  Essentially, most of the Earth's mass must be located towards the centre of the planet. The next step is to ask which heavy materials make up the core.  The answer here is that it's almost certainly made mostly of iron. The core is thought to be around 80% iron, though the exact figure is up for debate.  > An iron core would account for all that missing mass  The main evidence for this is the huge amount of iron in the universe around us. It is one of the ten most common elements in our galaxy, and is frequently found in meteorites.  Given how much there is of it, iron is much less common at the surface of the Earth than we might expect. So the theory is that when Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, a lot of iron worked its way down to the core.  That's where most of the mass is, and it's where most of the iron must be too. Iron is a relatively dense element under normal conditions, and under the extreme pressure at the Earth's core it would be crushed to an even higher density, so an iron core would account for all that missing mass.  But wait a minute. How did that iron get down there in the first place?  The iron must have somehow gravitated \u2013 literally \u2013 towards the centre of the Earth. But it's not immediately obvious how.  Most of the rest of the Earth is made up of rocks called silicates, and molten iron struggles to travel through them. Rather like how water on a greasy surface forms droplets, the iron clings to itself in little reservoirs, refusing to spread out and flow.  > The pressure actually changes the properties of how iron interacts with the silicate  A possible solution was discovered in 2013 by Wendy Mao of Stanford University in California and her colleagues. They wondered what happened when the iron and silicate were both exposed to extreme pressure, as happens deep in the earth.  By pinching both substances extremely tightly using diamonds, they were able to force molten iron through silicate.  \"The pressure actually changes the properties of how iron interacts with the silicate,\" says Mao. \"At higher pressures a 'melt network' is formed.\"  This suggests the iron was gradually squeezed down through the rocks of the Earth over millions of years, until it reached the core.  At this point you might be wondering how we know the size of the core. What makes scientists think it begins 3000km down? There's a one-word answer: seismology.  > All the seismic stations dotted all over the Earth recorded the arrival of the tremors  When an earthquake happens, it sends shockwaves throughout the planet. Seismologists record these vibrations. It's as if we hit one side of the planet with a gigantic hammer, and listened on the other side for the noise.  \"There was a Chilean earthquake in the 1960s that generated a huge amount of data,\" says Redfern. \"All the seismic stations dotted all over the Earth recorded the arrival of the tremors from that earthquake.\"  Depending on the route those vibrations take, they pass through different bits of the Earth, and this affects how they \"sound\" at the other end.  Early in the history of seismology, it was realised that some vibrations were going missing. These \"S-waves\" were expected to show up on one side of the Earth after originating on the other, but there was no sign of them.  > It turned out that rocks became liquid around 3000km down  The reason for this was simple. S-waves can only reverberate through solid material, and can't make it through liquid.  They must have come up against something molten in the centre of the Earth. By mapping the S-waves' paths, it turned out that rocks became liquid around 3000km down.  That suggested the entire core was molten. But seismology had another surprise in store.  In the 1930s, a Danish seismologist named Inge Lehmann noticed that another kind of waves, called P-waves, unexpectedly travelled through the core and could be detected on the other side of the planet.  > P-waves really were travelling through the core  She came up with a surprising explanation: the core is divided into two layers. The \"inner\" core, which begins around 5,000km down, was actually solid. It was only the \"outer\" core above it that was molten.  Lehmann's idea was eventually confirmed in 1970, when more sensitive seismographs found that P-waves really were travelling through the core and, in some cases, being deflected off it at angles. Sure enough, they still ended up on the other side of the planet.  It's not just earthquakes that sent useful shockwaves through the Earth. In fact, seismology owes a lot of its success to the development of nuclear weapons.  A nuclear detonation also creates waves in the ground, so nations use seismology to listen out for weapons tests. During the Cold War this was seen as hugely important, so seismologists like Lehmann got a lot of encouragement.  > This turns out to be quite tricky to determine  Rival countries found out about each other's nuclear capabilities and along the way we learned more and more about the core of the Earth. Seismology is still used to detect nuclear detonations today.  We can now draw a rough picture of the Earth's structure. There is a molten outer core, which begins roughly halfway to the planet's centre, and within it is the solid inner core with a diameter of 1,220 km.  But there is a lot more to try and tease out, especially about the inner core. For starters, how hot is it?  This turns out to be quite tricky to determine, and baffled scientists until quite recently, says Lidunka Vo\u010dadlo of University College London in the UK. We can't put a thermometer down there, so the only solution is to create the correct crushing pressure in the lab.  > Earth's core has stayed warm thanks to heat retained from the formation of the planet  In 2013 a team of French researchers produced the best estimate to date. They subjected pure iron to pressures a little over half that at the core, and extrapolated from there. They concluded that the melting point of pure iron at core temperatures is around 6,230 \u00b0C. The presence of other materials would bring the core's melting point down a bit, to around 6,000 \u00b0C. But that's still as hot as the surface of the Sun.  A bit like a toasty jacket potato, Earth's core has stayed warm thanks to heat retained from the formation of the planet. It also gets heat from friction as denser materials shift around, as well as from the decay of radioactive elements. Still, it is cooling by about 100 \u00b0C every billion years.  Knowing the temperature is useful, because it affects the speed at which vibrations travel through the core. That is handy, because there is something odd about the vibrations.  P-waves travel unexpectedly slowly as they go through the inner core \u2013 slower than they would if it was made of pure iron.  > It's a Cinderella problem: no shoe will quite fit  \"Wave velocities that the seismologists measure in earthquakes and whatnot are significantly lower [than] anything that we measure in an experiment or calculate on a computer,\" says Vo\u010dadlo. \"Nobody as yet knows why that is.\"  That suggests there is another material in the mix.  It could well be another metal, called nickel. But scientists have estimated how seismic waves would travel through an iron-nickel alloy, and it doesn't quite fit the readings either.  Vo\u010dadlo and her colleagues are now considering whether there might be other elements down there too, like sulphur and silicon. So far, no-one has been able to come up with a theory for the inner core's composition that satisfies everyone. It's a Cinderella problem: no shoe will quite fit.  > That could explain why the seismic waves pass through more slowly than expected  Vo\u010dadlo is trying to simulate the materials of the inner core on a computer. She hopes to find a combination of materials, temperatures and pressures that would slow down the seismic waves by the right amount.  She says the secret might lie in the fact that the inner core is nearly at its melting point. As a result, the precise properties of the materials might be different from what they would be if they were safely solid.  That could explain why the seismic waves pass through more slowly than expected.  \"If that's the real effect, we would be able to reconcile the mineral physics results with the seismological results,\" says Vocadlo. \"People have not been able to do that yet.\"  There are plenty of riddles about the earth's core still to solve. But without ever digging to those impossible depths, scientists have figured out a great deal about what is happening thousands of kilometres beneath us.  > The magnetic field helps to shield us from harmful solar radiation  Those hidden processes in the depths of the Earth are crucial to our daily lives, in a way many of us don't realise.  Earth has a powerful magnetic field, and that is all thanks to the partially molten core. The constant movement of molten iron creates an electrical current inside the planet, and that in turn generates a magnetic field that reaches far out into space.  The magnetic field helps to shield us from harmful solar radiation. If the core of the Earth wasn't the way it is, there would be no magnetic field, and we would have all sorts of problems to contend with.  None of us will ever set eyes on the core, but it's good to know it's there.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - How we know what lies at Earth's core", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150814-what-is-at-the-centre-of-earth", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "Spain", "Australia", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Chris Baraniuk"},{"newsText": "Light is what allows us to understand the world we live in. Our language reflects this: after groping in the dark, we see the light and understanding dawns.  Yet light is one of those things that we don't tend to understand. If you were to zoom in on a ray of light, what would you see? Sure, light travels incredibly fast, but what is it that's doing the travelling? Many of us would struggle to explain.  It doesn't have to be that way. Light certainly has puzzled the greatest minds for centuries, but landmark discoveries made over the last 150 years have robbed light of its mystery. We actually know, more or less, what it is.  Not only do today's physicists understand the nature of light, they are learning to control it with ever-greater precision \u2013 which means light could soon be put to work in surprising new ways. That is part of the reason why the United Nations designated 2015 as the International Year of Light.  There are all sorts of ways to describe light. But it might help to begin with this: **light is a form of radiation**.  > It wasn't until the late nineteenth century that scientists discovered the exact identity of light radiation  This hopefully makes some sense. We all know that too much sunlight can trigger skin cancer. We also know that radiation exposure can raise the risk of developing some forms of cancer, so it's not hard to put the two together.  But not all forms of radiation are the same. It wasn't until the late nineteenth century that scientists discovered the exact identity of light radiation.  The strange thing is, this discovery didn't come from the study of light. Instead it emerged from decades of work into the nature of electricity and magnetism.  Electricity and magnetism seem like quite different things. But scientists like Hans Christian Oersted and Michael Faraday established that they are deeply entwined.  Oersted found that an electric current passing through a wire deflects the needle of a magnetic compass. Meanwhile, Faraday discovered that moving a magnet near a wire can generate an electric current in the wire.  > Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields travel in the manner of waves  Mathematicians of the day set about using these observations to create a theory describing this strange new phenomenon, which they called \"electromagnetism\". But it wasn't until James Clerk Maxwell looked at the problem that a complete picture emerged.  Maxwell's contribution to science is huge. Albert Einstein, who was inspired by Maxwell, said that he changed the world forever. Among many other things, his calculations helped explain what light is.  Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields travel in the manner of waves, and that those waves move essentially at the speed of light. This allowed Maxwell to predict that light itself was carried by electromagnetic waves \u2013 which means **light is a form of electromagnetic radiation**.  In the late 1880s, a few years after Maxwell's death, German physicist Heinrich Hertz became the first to formally demonstrate that Maxwell's theoretical concept of the electromagnetic wave was correct.  > In 1861 he unveiled the first durable colour photograph  \"I am convinced that if Maxwell and Hertz had lived into the Nobel prize era, they would have surely shared one,\" says Graham Hall of the University of Aberdeen in the UK \u2013 where Maxwell worked in the late 1850s.  Maxwell holds a place in the annals of light science for another, more practical reason. In 1861 he unveiled the first durable colour photograph, produced using a three-colour filter system that still forms the basis of many forms of colour photography today.  Still, the idea that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation may not mean too much. But this idea helps to explain something that we all understand: **light is a spectrum of colours**.  This is an observation that goes back to the work of Isaac Newton. We see this colour spectrum in all its glory whenever a rainbow hangs in the sky \u2013 and those colours relate directly to Maxwell's concept of electromagnetic waves.  > Many animals can actually see ultraviolet, and so can some people  The red light along one edge of the rainbow is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of about 620 to 750 nanometres; the violet light along the opposite edge is radiation with a wavelength of 380 to 450nm.  But there is far more to electromagnetic radiation than these visible colours. Light with wavelengths slightly longer than the red light we see is called infrared. Light with wavelengths slightly shorter than violet is called ultraviolet.  Many animals can actually see ultraviolet, and so can some people, says Eleftherios Goulielmakis of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany. In some circumstances even infrared is visible to humans. Perhaps this is why it's not uncommon to see both ultraviolet and infrared described as forms of light.  Curiously, though, go to even longer \u2013 or shorter \u2013 electromagnetic wavelengths and we stop using the word \"light\".  Beyond ultraviolet, electromagnetic wavelengths can go shorter than 100nm. This is the realm of X-rays and gamma rays. You won't often hear X-rays described as a form of light.  > There is no real physical difference between radio waves and visible light  \"A scientist wouldn't say 'I'm shining X-ray light on the target'. They would say 'I'm using X-rays',\" says Goulielmakis.  Meanwhile, go beyond infrared and electromagnetic wavelength stretches to 1cm and even up to thousands of kilometres. These electromagnetic waves are given familiar names like microwaves and radio waves. It may seem strange to think of the radio waves used in broadcasting as light.  \"There is no real physical difference between radio waves and visible light from the point of view of physics,\" says Goulielmakis. \"You would describe them with exactly the same sort of equations and mathematics.\" It's only our everyday language that treats them as different.  So we have another definition of light. It is the very narrow range of electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can actually see. In other words, **light is a subjective label that we only use because our senses are limited**.  For more evidence of just how subjective our concept of light is, think back to the rainbow.  Most people learn that the spectrum of light contains seven main colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. We are even given handy mnemonics and songs to remember them.  Look at a strong rainbow and you can probably convince yourself that all seven colours are on show. However, Newton himself struggled to see them all.  In fact, researchers now suspect that he only divided the rainbow into seven colours because the number seven was so significant in the ancient world: for instance there are seven notes in a musical scale, and seven days in a week.  Maxwell's work on electromagnetism took us past all this, and showed that visible light was part of a larger spectrum of radiation. It also seemed to finally explain the nature of light.  For centuries, scientists had been trying to pin down the actual form that light takes at a fundamental scale as it travels from a light source to our eyes.  > Newton realised that rays of light obeyed very strict geometric rules  Some thought that light travelled in the form of waves or ripples, either through air or a more nebulous \"ether\". Others thought this wave model was wrong and imagined light as a stream of tiny particles.  Newton preferred this second option, particularly after a series of experiments he performed using light and mirrors.  He realised that rays of light obeyed very strict geometric rules. Shine a ray against a mirror and it bounced off in exactly the same way a ball would if it were thrown against the mirror. Waves don't necessarily move in such predictable straight lines, he reasoned, so light must be carried by some form of tiny, weightless particles.  The trouble is, there was equally compelling evidence that light is a wave.  One of the most famous demonstrations of this came in 1801. Thomas Young's \"double slit experiment\" is the sort of experiment anyone can replicate at home.  Take a sheet of thick card and carefully make two thin vertical slits through it. Then get a \"coherent\" light source, which only produces light of a particular wavelength: a laser will do nicely. Now shine the light through the two slits onto another surface.  On that second surface, you might expect to see two bright vertical lines where some of the light has passed through the two slits. But when Young performed the experiment, he saw a sequence of light and dark lines rather like a bar code.  When the light passes through the thin slits, it behaves in the same way that water waves do when they pass through a narrow opening: they diffract and spread out in the form of hemispherical ripples.  Where the \"light ripples\" from the two slits hit each other out of phase they cancel out, forming dark bars. Where the ripples hit each other in phase, they add together to made bright vertical lines.  Young's experiment was compelling evidence of the wave model, and Maxwell's work put the idea on a solid mathematical footing. **Light is a wave**.  But then came the quantum revolution.  In the second half of the nineteenth century, physicists were trying to understand how and why some materials absorbed and emitted electromagnetic radiation better than others.  > In 1900, Max Planck solved the problem  That may sound a bit niche, but the electric light industry was emerging at the time, so materials that could emit light were a big thing.  By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists had discovered that the amount of electromagnetic radiation released by an object changed depending on its temperature, and they had measured these changes. But no one knew why it happened.  In 1900, Max Planck solved the problem. He discovered that the calculations could explain those changes, but only if he assumed that the electromagnetic radiation was held in tiny discrete packets. Planck called these \"quanta\", the plural of \"quantum\".  A few years later, Einstein used this idea to explain another puzzling experiment.  Physicists had discovered that a chunk of metal becomes positively charged when it is bathed in visible or ultraviolet light. They called this the \"photoelectric effect\".  > This doesn't make much sense if light is simply a wave  The explanation was that atoms in the metal were losing negatively-charged electrons. Apparently, the light delivered enough energy to the metal to shake some of them loose.  But the detail of what the electrons were doing was odd. They could be made to carry more energy simply by changing the colour of light. In particular, the electrons released from a metal bathed in violet light carried more energy than electrons released by a metal bathed in red light.  This doesn't make much sense if light is simply a wave.  You usually change the amount of energy in a wave by making it taller \u2013 think of the destructive power of a tall tsunami \u2013 rather than by making the wave itself longer or shorter.  > Each quantum packs a discrete energy punch  By extension, the best way to increase the energy that light transfers to the electrons should be by making the light waves taller: that is, making the light brighter. Changing the wavelength, and thus the colour, shouldn't make as much of a difference.  Einstein realised that the photoelectric effect was easier to understand by thinking of light in terms of Planck's quanta.  He suggested that light is carried in tiny quantum packets. Each quantum packs a discrete energy punch that relates to the wavelength: the shorter the wavelength, the denser the energy punch. This would explain why violet light packets, with a relatively short wavelength, carried more energy than red light packets, with a relatively longer one.  It also explained why simply increasing the brightness of the light made less of an impact.  A brighter light source delivers more light packets to the metal, but it doesn't change the amount of energy each light packet contains. Crudely speaking, a single violet light packet could transfer more energy to a single electron than any number of red light packets.  > The scientists decided that light behaved as both a wave and a particle at the same time  Einstein called these energy packets photons, and these are now recognised as a fundamental particle. Visible light is carried by photons, and so are all the other kinds of electromagnetic radiation like X-rays, microwaves and radio waves. In other words, **light is a particle**.  At this point physicists decided to end the debate over whether light behaved as a wave or a particle. Both models were so convincing that neither could be rejected.  To the confusion of many non-physicists, the scientists decided that light behaved as both a wave and a particle at the same time. In other words, **light is a paradox**.  Physicists, though, have no problem with light's split identity. If anything, it makes light doubly useful. Today, building on the work of luminaries \u2013 literally \"light-givers\" \u2013 like Maxwell and Einstein, we are squeezing even more out of light.  It turns out that the equations used to describe light-as-a-wave and light- as-a-particle work equally well, but in some circumstances one is easier to use than the other. So physicists switch between them, just as we use metres to describe our own height but switch to kilometres to describe a bicycle ride.  > Entangled particles can be used to communicate information  Some physicists are trying to use light to create encrypted channels of communication: for money transfers, for instance. For them, it makes sense to think of light as particles.  This is because of another strange quirk of quantum physics. Two fundamental particles, like a pair of photons, can be \"entangled\". This means they share properties no matter how far apart they are from one another, so they can be used to communicate information between two points on Earth.  Another feature of this entanglement is that the quantum state of the photons changes when they are read. That means if anyone tried to eavesdrop on a channel encrypted using the quantum properties of light, they would, in theory, immediately betray their presence.  Others, like Goulielmakis, are using light in electronics. For them it is far more useful to think of light as a series of waves that can be tamed and controlled.  Modern devices called \"light field synthesisers\" can corral light waves into perfect synchrony with each other. As a result, they create light pulses that are far more intense, short-lived and directed than the light from an ordinary bulb.  > They literally took photos of light waves moving  Over the last 15 years, these devices have been used to tame light to an extraordinary degree.  In 2004 Goulielmakis and his colleagues managed to produce incredibly short pulses of X-ray radiation. Each pulse lasted just 250 attoseconds, or 250 quintillionths of a second.  Using these tiny pulses like a camera flash, they managed to capture images of individual waves of visible light, which oscillate rather slower. They literally took photos of light waves moving.  \"We've known since Maxwell that light is an oscillating electromagnetic field, but nobody dreamed we would be able to capture the light as it oscillates,\" says Goulielmakis.  Seeing those individual light waves is a first step towards controlling and sculpting them, he says, much as we already sculpt much longer electromagnetic waves, like the radio waves that carry radio and television signals.  A century ago, the photoelectric effect showed that visible light affects the electrons in a metal. Goulielmakis says it should be possible to precisely manipulate those electrons, using visible light waves that have been shaped to interact with the metals in a carefully defined way. \"We can control the light, and through it we can control matter,\" he says.  > Human eyes are photon detectors that use visible light to learn about the world around us  That could revolutionise electronics, leading to new generations of optical computers that are smaller and faster than those we have today. \"It's about setting electrons in motion in ways we want, creating electric currents inside solids using light, instead of conventional electronics.\"  So there is one more way light can be described: **light is a tool**.  That is nothing new. Life has been harnessing light ever since the first primitive organisms evolved light-sensitive tissues. Human eyes are photon detectors that use visible light to learn about the world around us.  Modern technology is simply taking this idea even further. In 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to researchers who built a light microscope so powerful, it was thought to be physically impossible. It turned out that, with a bit of persuasion, light would show us things we thought we would never see.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - What is a ray of light made of?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150731-what-is-a-ray-of-light-made-of", "countriesMentioned": ["Hong Kong", "United Kingdom", "United States", "New Zealand", "Australia", "Canada"], "author": "Colin Barras"},{"newsText": "The first three were taken by professional photographers.

The sky was glowing green and sparks were falling like rain.  Soon the blaze turned blood-red, illuminating streets, houses, and\u00a0sombre faces.\u00a0The light show was visible from Hawaii to London.  Some people thought it was a message from God, or an omen of famine, or revolution. The more scientifically-minded guessed it had something to do with the weather. Perhaps it marked the beginning of a cold snap.  In fact, it was a new kind of weather. Just 17 hours earlier in England, astronomer Richard Carrington had been sketching spots on the Sun's surface when a patch of intensely bright white light appeared, then vanished.  Carrington knew he'd seen something big, and the timing was uncanny. But at first he was hesitant to link the two events. An electric light show from space, powered by a storm on the Sun, was just too incredible.  Eventually he did draw the link, and over the years it became clear that he was right. We like to think of the Sun as an unwavering beacon, beaming steadily from day to day, century to century. Carrington showed that the truth is far more spectacular and violent.  The blaze that lit the heavens was caused by a super-explosion on the Sun, equivalent to ten billion atomic bombs. In our solar system, it was the biggest stellar outburst of the last 500 years.  > Everyday fluctuations in the Sun's activity aren't a problem, because the Earth is protected by its magnetic field  Now known as the Carrington event, it was an unusually extreme bout of \"space weather\": the conditions arising from the Sun's varying activity. Space weather is a hostile world of magnetic storms and solar wind, of electric rain, plasma clouds, and toxic radiation.  According to a UK government report released in July 2015, a repeat of the Carrington event would likely cause unprecedented chaos. It would disrupt satellite communications and GPS navigation, and trigger global blackouts lasting up to a year. That's no radio, television, or phone signal, internet, mains-powered electrical devices, or heating.  Trains and traffic lights would fail. With no GPS navigation to guide them, there would be no flights, and with most of the world's cash stored in electronic databases, very little money either.  In all, it could be devastating to the modern world, amounting to trillions of dollars' worth of damage.  Everyday fluctuations in the Sun's activity aren't a problem, because the Earth is protected by its magnetic field. You might not be aware it's happening, but you certainly wouldn't want to be without it.  Take it from astronaut Chris Hadfield, who spent 145 days on the International Space Station (ISS) from 2012 to 2013, and kept busy while he was up there.  \"In space, if you just close your eyes and wait, every so often you will see a flash of light,\" says Hadfield.  Each flash is a cosmic ray, a high-energy particle that has slipped through the walls of the ISS and crashed directly into your optic nerve, causing it to fire a signal to the brain.  \"It might be from our Sun or from any other star in the universe,\" says Hadfield. \"It's travelled all that immense distance and you can actually see the radiation with your own vision system.\"  Because we're closer to the Sun than to any other star, it sends us a lot more stuff.  In school we're often taught that the Sun is a ball of gas, but technically this isn't true. Really it is made of plasma: gas that is so hot, the atoms have broken apart into smaller charged particles.  > Like the Earth, the Sun has its own magnetic field  Plasma is not as exotic as it sounds. It's the same stuff that fills fluorescent lights and plasma television screens \u2013 except that, at the Sun's surface, it's over 5,500 \u00b0C.  On a calm day, this destructive \"vapour\" streams off the Sun in all directions, reaching far beyond Neptune \u2013 more than 100 times the distance from the Sun to Earth.  Just occasionally, our star presents its more capricious side.  Like the Earth, the Sun has its own magnetic field. It has a magnetic north and south, and field lines running down between them.  > Even at their worst, the Sun's flares are not physically capable of destroying Earth  As the Sun rotates the plasma moves too, and the faster currents at the equator distort the magnetic field lines. In sunspots the field lines get really twisted and loops rise through the surface, pulling bubbles of plasma with them. Occasionally the lines become so strained, one will snap.  Cue one of the most dramatic events in our solar system: a solar flare. These monstrous explosions in the Sun's atmosphere fling out radiation. Travelling at the speed of light, the radiation takes just 8 minutes to reach Earth. This was the burst of white light seen by Carrington.  It was followed by a second solar deluge: a coronal mass ejection (CME), a cloud containing up to a billion tons of plasma. It takes several hours for a CME to break away from the Sun's surface, but once free they travel at up to 7 million miles per hour. In 1859, the CME took about 17 hours to hit Earth.  All this pummelling can have some radical impacts here on Earth.  Let's get one thing out of the way immediately. NASA is clear that \"even at their worst, the Sun's flares are not physically capable of destroying Earth.\"  > The visual effects of the Sun's power were flowing between my legs  The most visible effects are spectacular auroras, colourful light displays in the sky. They are normally only visible close to the north and south poles, but a CME can trigger them worldwide.  When the plasma from a CME reaches Earth, it slams into the atoms of gases in the upper atmosphere. The impact strips the electrons from these atoms, briefly turning them into plasma. The atoms then recombine, and emit light in the process.  \"Normal\" auroras are induced by the steady solar wind and occur year-round. They are best appreciated from outer space.  \"When I was out for one of my spacewalks we actually went through the Aurora Australis, the southern lights,\" says Hadfield. \"The visual effects of the Sun's power were flowing between my legs.\"  The other impacts of a solar superstorm are significantly less appealing.  The plasma shock wave affects the Earth's magnetic field, creating a violent distortion called a \"geomagnetic storm\" that lasts 6-12 hours. As a result, things get electric.  The rapidly-changing magnetic field generates an electrical current in any conductive material near the ground, including telephone and power lines, undersea cables, and oil and gas pipelines. Once the electrical surges reach the power grid, they overload transformers and trip their circuit breakers, causing widespread blackouts.  > The blast created a geomagnetic storm and powerful electric currents  In 1859 there wasn't an electrical grid. Instead the storm burned out telegraph wires, the 19th-century equivalent of the internet, all over the world. Pylons threw sparks, telegraph paper caught fire, switchboards blew, and a few unlucky operators were thrown across the room.  On the American telegraph line, electrical currents disrupted the service at several points. Elsewhere, operators found they could disconnect the batteries and transmit their signals via the geomagnetic current alone.  \"How do you receive my writing?\" read a telegraph from an operator in Boston. \"Much better than with the batteries on,\" came the reply from Portland.  In 2015 the world is very different. Over 80% of people now rely on electric power. What would happen if a solar superstorm hit?  We can get a hint of the answer from a blast with one-third of the power of the Carrington event, which struck in 1989. It doesn't look good.  The blast created a geomagnetic storm and powerful electric currents. These currents found a weak spot in Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's electrical grid and shut down the power for the entire province of Quebec within 2 minutes. The blackout lasted 12 hours, closing schools and businesses, leaving people stranded in elevators, and halting all trading on Toronto's stock market.  > A strong geomagnetic current would melt the insides of these transformers and destroy them  A bigger surge might be strong enough to destroy the national grid itself.  The vulnerable components are called extra-high-voltage transformers, which are used to convert the high-voltage electricity from power stations into lower-voltage electricity that we can use in our houses. They are the foundation of civilisation as we know it.  Unfortunately they are also heavy, tricky to transport, and must be custom- designed. They can take months to make and up to a year to arrive, and cost about $10 million each. Understandably, power companies don't keep many spares.  A strong geomagnetic current would melt the insides of these transformers and destroy them.  A 2011 report estimated that a storm half the strength of the Carrington event would destroy 300 transformers in the US alone, leaving 130 million people without power for up to 12 months. Backup generators would only have enough power to keep water and sewage systems going for a few days. After that there would be no clean water or sanitation.  > If the stations don't fire their engines, they may simply fall out of the sky  We might also lose a lot of money. Banks store people's cash in databases, so if a geomagnetic current found its way to a data centre it could delete millions of people's savings.  Up in space, the satellites we use for communications, navigation, and weather forecasting are at risk. Plasma particles can collide with crucial electronics, disabling them.  Hadfield says this isn't a problem for the ISS. \"We're really, really careful with our power. It's something we've thought about and planned for,\" he says. \"If we have a short because of a huge burst of energy, then the solar arrays have ways to disconnect themselves from the batteries\".  There's another risk. All satellites in low orbits, including manned stations like the ISS and China's Tiangong-1, could get dragged back down to Earth.  After a big solar event, the extra energy from the Sun swells the Earth's atmosphere, pushing it higher into orbit and thickening the air.  > Solar flares emit all kinds of radiation, from visible light to ultraviolet and X-rays  \"The furthest atoms out, they actually drag the station down, like tiny little tendrils,\" says Hadfield. \"So we either need to stay further away from the Earth or we need to fire our engines more often to re-boost our orbit and push us up higher.\"  If the stations don't fire their engines, they may simply fall out of the sky. That is what happened to Skylab, a $2.2 billion space station that preceded the ISS - although it had long since been abandoned. Similarly, the Solar Maximum Mission fell out of orbit shortly after the 1989 storm, which was ironic because it was designed to investigate space weather.  The extra heating also expands a layer of charged particles called the ionosphere, which radio signals back to Earth must pass through. The thicker ionosphere creates turbulence, delaying the signals. For tasks like GPS, which rely on transmissions that are timed to a billionth of a second, this disruption can be devastating.  Then there are the risks to life itself.  Solar flares emit all kinds of radiation, from visible light to ultraviolet and X-rays. This onslaught is usually deflected by the Earth's magnetic field, but in the aftermath of a solar storm the field is weakened \u2013 just when the radiation becomes more intense.  People high up in the sky, for instance on planes, get more radiation than people on the ground. After a large solar flare in 2003, one study into the radiation exposure of passengers in the air at the time found that those on polar flights, such as Washington to Beijing, may have received up to 70% of the recommended yearly limit all in one go.  > Robins can literally see the Earth's magnetic field  However, this isn't necessarily as bad as it sounds. Recommended doses are deliberately conservative, and it is actually not possible to identify the impacts of such a low dose because they are so subtle. Based on a 2008 study of radiation risks, the radiation from the solar storm would have carried a risk of death from cancer equivalent to driving 186 miles in a car, something most of us would do without hesitation.  Astronauts are more at risk. During the same event, radiation levels spiked on the ISS, so the astronauts retreated deep within the body of the station.  Other life may be affected, too. Many animals are thought to navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Could a solar storm throw them off course?  Few people have tried to find out but it certainly looks like it. A 2015 study of the impacts of space weather on honeybee colonies found that, over a 3-year period, the number of lost bees increased by a factor of three on storm days.  Some migratory birds are also known to have a magnetic sense: for instance, robins can literally see the Earth's magnetic field. Nobody has studied whether solar storms affect their ability to navigate. Just in case, many pigeon racers call the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center before big races to check for any unusual solar activity.  It seems clear that another big storm would trigger a whole string of consequences on Earth. But we don't know when it will happen.  The Sun goes through an 11-year cycle, going from a quiet \"solar minimum\" to a tempestuous \"solar maximum\" and back again. You might think that a big flare would be more likely at solar maximum, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  > The risk of another Carrington event is about 12% over the next 10 years  \"There's absolutely no correlation,\" says Catherine Burnett, the space weather programme manager at the Met Office in Exeter, UK. \"Extreme solar events could happen at any time. In fact, Carrington was at solar minimum.\"  The rarity of super-storms like the one Carrington saw means there's very little data with which to assess how often they occur. However, in 2012 Pete Riley of Predictive Science in San Diego, California, US had a go anyway.  Riley looked for patterns in the severity of milder space weather events and extrapolated to more severe ones. He estimates that the risk of another Carrington event is about 12% over the next 10 years.  The good news is, if one does happen, we will get some warning.  Solar flares travel at the speed of light, so by the time we see them, they're here. The only way to forecast them is by guessing the probability that a sunspot will flare. Because tangled magnetic fields are more likely to snap, we can estimate the risk of a flare by gauging how magnetically \"complex\" a sunspot is.  > If it's oriented southward, it will impact the Earth  Happily, CMEs can take up to 96 hours to arrive. To find them, forecasters scour high-resolution images of the Sun for signs of solar flares, which usually happen at around the same time.  Next the CME's speed and density are modelled using supercomputers, to forecast when it will arrive and if it's likely to be a big one. But it's an imperfect process. \"Actually we don't know whether or not it will impact the Earth until it travels almost all the way,\" says Burnett.  The space weather community has a satellite called the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) that can measure the magnetic orientation of CMEs. By the time a CME passes ACE, it may be just 15 minutes from Earth.  \"If it's oriented southward, it will impact the Earth,\" says Burnett. \"If it's northward it won't, it will just pass round the Earth's magnetic field and we won't feel anything.\"  With our reliance on modern technology increasing by the day, we're certainly upping the stakes of another solar mega-event. Without computers, electric lights, or flushing toilets, it could send large parts of the world back to the 18th century. It might be worth stocking up on batteries and stashing some cash under the mattress.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The Sun creates 'space weather' that affects us all", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150923-the-sun-creates-space-weather-that-affects-us-all", "countriesMentioned": ["China", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "Australia", "Hungary", "South Africa", "Russia", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Zaria Gorvett"},{"newsText": "Atoms are small. Really, really small. You\u2019ll probably have heard that matter is made of bundles of these tiny things. You\u2019ll likely also know that you can\u2019t see them with the naked eye. We are told to take on trust the idea that atoms are there, interacting with each other and being building blocks for our world.  For most people, though, that\u2019s not good enough. Science prides itself on the way it uses real observations to work out the mysteries of the universe \u2013 so how did we come to conclude that atoms exist, and what have we learned about these tiny structures?  It might seem as if there\u2019s a simple way to prove atoms exist: put them under the microscope. But this approach won\u2019t work. In fact, even the most powerful light-focusing microscopes can\u2019t visualise single atoms. What makes an object visible is the way it deflects visible light waves. Atoms are so much smaller than the wavelength of visible light that the two don\u2019t really interact. To put it another way, atoms are invisible to light itself. However, atoms do have observable effects on some of the things we can see.  Hundreds of years ago in 1785 Dutch scientist Jan Ingenhousz was studying a strange phenomenon that he couldn\u2019t quite make sense of. Minute particles of coal dust were darting about on the surface of some alcohol in his lab.  > Even the most powerful light-focusing microscopes can\u2019t visualise single atoms  About 50 years later, in 1827, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown described something curiously similar. He had his microscope trained on some pollen grains. Brown noticed that some of the grains released tiny particles \u2013 which would then move away from the pollen grain in a random jittery dance.  At first, Brown wondered if the particles were really some sort of unknown organism. He repeated the experiment with other substances like rock dust, which he knew wasn\u2019t alive, and saw the same strange motion again.  It would take almost another century for science to offer an explanation. Einstein came along and developed a mathematical formula that would predict this very particular type of movement \u2013 by then called Brownian motion, after Robert Brown.  Einstein\u2019s theory was that that the particles from the pollen grains were being moved around because they were constantly crashing into millions of tinier molecules of water \u2013 molecules that were made of atoms.  > It might come as a surprise that atoms can be broken down \u2013 particularly since \u201catomos\u201d means \u201cindivisible\u201d  \u201cHe explains this jiggling motion that you see as actually being caused by the impact of individual water molecules on the particles of dust or whatever it is that you\u2019ve got on your liquid,\u201d explains Harry Cliff at the University of Cambridge, who is also a curator at London\u2019s Science Museum.  By 1908, observations backed with calculations had confirmed that atoms were real. Within about a decade, physicists would be able to go further. By pulling apart individual atoms they began to get a sense of their internal structure.  It might come as a surprise that atoms can be broken down \u2013 particularly since the very name atom derives from a Greek term \u201catomos\u201d, which means \u201cindivisible\u201d. But physicists now know that atoms are not solid little balls. It\u2019s better to think of them as tiny electrical, \u201cplanetary\u201d systems. They\u2019re typically made up of three main parts: protons, neutrons and electrons. Think of the protons and neutrons as together forming a \u201csun\u201d, or nucleus, at the centre of the system. The electrons orbit this nucleus, like planets.  If atoms are impossibly small, these subatomic particles are even more so. Funnily enough, the first particle that was discovered was actually the smallest of the three \u2013 the electron.  To get an idea of the size difference here, protons in the nucleus are actually around 1,830 times as large as electrons. Picture a small marble orbiting a hot air balloon \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of discrepancy we\u2019re talking about here.  > It\u2019s one of the first particle accelerators in a way  But how do we know those particles are there? The answer is because, although tiny, they can have a big impact. The British physicist who discovered electrons, JJ Thomson, used a particularly eye-catching method to prove their existence in 1897.  His special device was called a Crookes tube \u2013 a funny shaped piece of glass out of which nearly all the air was sucked by a machine. Then, a negative electrical charge was applied to one end of the tube. This charge was enough to strip the remaining gas molecules in the tube of some of their electrons. Electrons are negatively charged, so they flew down the tube towards the other end. Thanks to the partial vacuum, those electrons were able to shoot through the tube without any big atoms getting in their way.  The electrical charge made the electrons move very quickly indeed \u2013 around 37,000 miles per second (59,500 kilometres per second) \u2013 until they smashed into the glass at the far end, knocking into yet more electrons associated with the atoms there. Amazingly, the collisions between these mind-bogglingly tiny particles generated so much energy that it created a fantastic green- yellow glow.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of the first particle accelerators in a way,\u201d says Cliff. \u201cIt\u2019s accelerating electrons from one end of the tube to the other and they strike the screen at the other end and give this phosphorescent glow.\u201d  > The discovery of the electron suggested there was more to learn about atoms  Because Thomson found that he could actually steer the beams of electrons with magnets and electrical fields, he knew they weren\u2019t just weird rays of light \u2013 they had to be charged particles.  And if you\u2019re wondering how these electrons could go flying around independently of their atoms, that\u2019s because of a process called ionisation, in which \u2013 in this case \u2013 an electrical charge changes the atom\u2019s structure by pushing those electrons off into the space around.  In fact, it\u2019s because electrons are so easily manipulated and moved around that electrical circuits are possible. Electrons in a copper wire travel in a train-like motion from one atom of copper to the next \u2013 and it\u2019s that which carries the charge through the wire to the other end. Atoms, it\u2019s worth noting again, are not solid little pieces of matter, but systems that may be modified or undergo structural changes.  But the discovery of the electron suggested there was more to learn about atoms. Thomson\u2019s work revealed that electrons are negatively charged \u2013 but he knew that atoms themselves had no overall charge. He reasoned they must contain mysterious positively charged particles to cancel out the negatively charged electrons.  > He had demonstrated the existence of a dense nucleus within the atom  Experiments at the beginning of the 20th Century identified those positively charged particles and at the same time revealed the atom\u2019s solar system-like internal structure.  Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues took very thin metal foil and put it under a beam of positively charged radiation \u2013 a stream of small particles. Most of the powerful radiation sailed right through, just as Rutherford thought it would, given how thin the foil was. But surprisingly, some of it bounced back.  Rutherford reasoned that the atoms in the metal foil must contain small, dense areas with a positive charge \u2013 nothing else would have the potential to reflect the radiation to such a strong degree. He had found the positive charges in the atom \u2013 and simultaneously proved they were all bunched together in a tight mass in a way that electrons aren\u2019t. In other words, he had demonstrated the existence of a dense nucleus within the atom.  > Cambridge physicist James Chadwick was desperate to discover the neutron  However, there was still a problem. By now, the mass of atoms could be estimated. But given what was known about how heavy a particle in the nucleus should be, the idea that they were all positively charged didn\u2019t make sense.  \u201cCarbon has six electrons and therefore six protons in the nucleus \u2013 six positive charges and six negative charges,\u201d explains Cliff. \u201cBut the nucleus of carbon doesn\u2019t weigh six protons, it weighs [the equivalent of] 12 protons.\u201d  Early on it was thought the other six nuclear particles would have the same mass as protons but be neutrally charged: neutrons. But no-one could prove this. In fact, neutrons weren\u2019t actually discovered until the 1930s.  Cambridge physicist James Chadwick was desperate to discover the neutron. He\u2019d been working on the theory for years. In 1932, he made a breakthrough.  > In the 1930s we had figured out a lot about atoms, but no-one had produced a direct image of one  A few years earlier, other physicists had been experimenting with radiation. They fired positively charged radiation \u2013 the same sort that Rutherford had used to discover the nucleus \u2013 at beryllium atoms. The beryllium kicked out radiation of its own: radiation that was neither positively nor negatively charged, and that could penetrate far through material.  By this time, others had already worked out that gamma radiation was neutral and deeply penetrating, so the physicists assumed this is what the beryllium atoms were releasing. But Chadwick wasn\u2019t convinced.  He generated some of the new radiation himself and aimed it at a substance which he knew was rich in protons. Unexpectedly, the protons were knocked into the air away from the material as though they had been hit by particles with the same mass \u2013 like snooker balls being hit by other snooker balls.  Gamma radiation can\u2019t deflect protons this way, so Chadwick realised the particles in question here must have the same mass as the proton but lack its electrical charge: they were neutrons.  All the key bits of the atom had been figured out, but the story doesn\u2019t stop there.  > You can even work out what atoms look like by poking at them  Although we had figured out a lot more about atoms than we had before, they were still difficult to visualise. And back in the 1930s, no-one had produced a direct image of one \u2013 which is what many people would want to see in order to really accept that they are there.  Importantly, though, the techniques that had been used by scientists like Thomson, Rutherford and Chadwick, would pave the way for new equipment that would eventually help us produce those images. The beams of electrons Thomson generated in his Crookes tube experiment proved particularly useful.  Today similar beams are generated by electron microscopes, and the most powerful of these microscopes can actually create images of individual atoms. This is because an electron beam can have a wavelength thousands of times shorter than a light beam \u2013 so short, in fact, that electron waves can be deflected by tiny atoms to generate an image in a way that light beams can\u2019t.  Neal Skipper at University College London says such images are useful for people who want to study the atomic structure of special substances \u2013 those used to make batteries for electric cars, for example. The more we know about their atomic structure, the better we can design them to be efficient and reliable.  You can even work out what atoms look like by poking at them. This is essentially how atomic force microscopy works.  > In a liquid, as you heat it up, you can see the atoms have more disordered configurations  The idea is to bring the tip of an extremely small probe close to the surface of a molecule or a material\u2019s surface. At such close quarters, the probe will be sensitive to the chemical structure of whatever it\u2019s pointed at, and the change in resistance as it moves across it allows scientists to produces images of what, for example, an individual molecule looks like.  Recently, researchers published wonderful images of a molecule before and after a chemical reaction using this method.  Skipper adds that a lot of atomic research today explores how the structure of things changes when a high pressure, or extreme temperature, is applied. Most people know that when a material is heated, it often expands. It\u2019s now possible to detect the atomic changes that occur which makes this possible.  \u201cIn a liquid, as you heat it up, you can see the atoms have more disordered configurations,\u201d says Skipper. \u201cYou can see that from the structural map directly.\u201d  Skipper and other physicists can also work on atoms using the neutron beams first identified by Chadwick in the 1930s.  > You can identify atoms by detecting the energy of gamma rays alone  \u201cWhat we do a lot is to fire beams of neutrons at lumps of materials and from the scattering pattern that emerges you can figure out that you were scattering neutrons from the nucleus,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can work out the mass and the rough size of the object that was doing the scattering.\u201d  But atoms aren\u2019t always just sitting there, calmly stable, waiting to be examined. Sometimes they are decaying \u2013 which means they are radioactive.  There are lots of naturally occurring radioactive elements. The process generates energy, which forms the basis of nuclear power \u2013 and nuclear bombs. Nuclear physicists\u2019 research generally involves trying to better understand reactions in which the nucleus undergoes fundamental changes like these.  Laura Harkness-Brennan at the University of Liverpool specialises in the study of gamma rays \u2013 a type of radiation emitted by decaying atoms. A radioactive atom of a given type generates a specific form of gamma ray. That means you can identify atoms by detecting the energy of gamma rays alone \u2013 and this is exactly what Harkness-Brennan does in her lab.  > We haven\u2019t just worked out what atoms are, we\u2019ve realised that they are marvellously complex structures  \u201cThe types of detectors that you would use are detectors that allow you to measure both the presence of the radiation but also the energy of the radiation that\u2019s being deposited,\u201d she says, \u201cand that\u2019s because the nuclei all have a characteristic fingerprint.\u201d  Because there might be all sorts of atoms present in an area where radiation is detected, especially after a large nuclear reaction of some kind, it\u2019s important to know precisely which radioactive isotopes are present. This sort of detection is commonly done in nuclear power plants, or areas where there have been nuclear disasters.  Harkness-Brennan and her colleagues are now working on detection systems that can be set up in such places to show, in three dimensions, where radiation might be present in a particular room. \u201cWhat you want to do is to have techniques and tools that allow you to image a three dimensional space and tell you in that room, in that pipe, that\u2019s where the radiation is,\u201d she says.  > Given how small the atom is it\u2019s amazing how much physics we can get out of it  It\u2019s also possible to visualise radiation in a \u201ccloud chamber\u201d. This is a special experiment in which alcohol vapour, cooled to -40C, drifts in a cloud around a radioactive source. Charged particles of radiation flying away from the source remove the electrons from alcohol molecules. This makes the alcohol condense into liquid around the path of the emitted particle. The results of this type of detection are really rather stunning.  We haven\u2019t just worked out what atoms are, we\u2019ve realised that they are marvellously complex structures that can undergo amazing changes \u2013 many of which occur naturally. And by studying atoms this way, we\u2019ve been able to improve our technologies, harness the energy of nuclear reactions and better understand the natural world around us. We\u2019ve also been able to better protect ourselves from radiation and discover how materials change when placed under extreme conditions.  Harkness-Brennan puts it well: \u201cGiven how small the atom is it\u2019s amazing how much physics we can get out of it.\u201d  Everything we can see around us is made of these little things. It\u2019s good to know they\u2019re down there, making it all possible.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - How do we know that things are really made of atoms?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151120-how-do-we-know-that-things-are-really-made-of-atoms", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "Australia"], "author": "Chris Baraniuk"},{"newsText": "**Fairy Chimneys, Turkey**  These strange conical spires are found in the Cappadocia region of Turkey.  Several million years ago, active volcanoes spewed volcanic ash that covered the ground. Rainwater and wind eroded the soft compressed volcanic ash, leaving behind the harder overlying basalts, forming the fairy chimneys.  **Ha Long Bay, Vietnam**  This spectacular landscape is dotted with limestone pillars, arches and caves. The rocks have been shaped by the repeated rise and fall of the sea over 500 million years. The bay also includes over 1600 islands and islets, most of them uninhabited.  According to legends, dragons created the islands and rocks to keep invaders out of Vietnam.  **Eye of the Sahara, Mauritania**  Formally known as the Richat Structure, the Eye of the Sahara looks like a bullseye from above.  Located in the Sahara desert, it is a dome-shaped rock structure about 50 km across. Once thought to have been caused by a meteorite impact, it is now believed to have formed from uplifted rock that was later eroded.  **The Great Blue Hole, Belize**  This underwater sinkhole is 320 m wide and 125 m deep, and a major scuba diving attraction. It is part of the Belize Barrier Reef, which is in turn part of the Mesoamerican Reef.  This hole is believed to have formed during the recent ice ages, when a submerged limestone cave system collapsed due to changes in the sea level. Huge stalactites and stalagmites are found in the hole, which contain records of past climates.  **Moeraki Boulders, New Zealand**  Resembling giant turtle shells, these spherical boulders lie strewn on New Zealand's Koekohe Beach.  These boulders started forming in sediments on the sea floor over 60 million years ago. Carbonates built up around a central core, similar to the way pearls form around a speck of grit.  According to Maori legends, the boulders are remnants of gourds and eel baskets, washed ashore from the wreck of a sailing canoe.  **Zhangye Danxia, China**  These rainbow mountains look like something out of a painting. The Danxia landforms, found in China's Gansu Province, are made of strips of red sandstone that were deposited over millions of years, like slices of a layered cake.  But a word of caution: many online pictures of these hills are probably the result of image manipulation.  **Stone Forest, China**  Blade-like columns of limestone, many over 10 m tall, form a landscape that resembles a forest of stones. The region is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The stone forests formed some 270 million years ago in what was once a shallow sea. Sandstone and limestone accumulated in the basin, and was eventually pushed up into the air. The rocks were then shaped by wind and water to create these spectacular stone pillars.  **Valley of the Moon, Argentina**  Arid and rugged, this barren landscape looks like \u2013 you guessed it - the surface of the Moon. But it is actually a fossil graveyard.  The site contains undisturbed deposits from 250-200 million years ago. Fossils of some of the oldest dinosaurs, fish, amphibians, reptiles and over 100 species of plants have been found. There are also huge petrified tree trunks.  **Wave Rock, Australia**  This concave rock is 14 m high and 110 m long. It is part of the northern side of Hyden Rock, a giant granite outcrop over 2.7 billion years old, located in Hyden Wildlife Park in Western Australia.  The wave is believed to have formed by the action of running water on granite. The colourful streaks on its face are made of minerals left behind by rainwater run-off.  **Chocolate Hills, the Philippines**  There are about 1500 of these limestone mounds in Bohol province in the Philippines. They are normally covered by grass, but turn a deep-brown colour during the dry season.  In 1988, the Chocolate Hills were declared the Philippines' third National Geological Monument.  **Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland**  These massive hexagonal black basalt columns rise like steps and interlock neatly. There are over 40,000.  They probably formed after volcanic activity 50-60 million years ago. The sizes of the columns were most likely determined by the speed at which the erupted lava cooled.  **Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah**  Located on the Colorado Plateau, the Bryce Canyon in southern Utah is a natural amphitheatre filled with spires and hoodoos. The Paiute Native Americans called it \"red rocks standing like men in a bowl-shaped canyon\".  The hoodoos were formed when water repeatedly froze and melted in the vertical cracks of sedimentary rocks. Some hoodoos are taller than a 10-storey building.  **Vermillion Cliffs National Monument, Arizona**  Popular among hikers, Vermillion Cliffs is a treasure trove of deep canyons and steep cliffs. It is also home to \"The Wave\" (pictured), which is made up of undulating sandstone.  The Monument is located on the Colorado Plateau, and gets its rich reddish hues from the sandstone that formed the landscape. The colours of the site change as the day progresses.  **Cave of the Crystals, Mexico**  This cave contains gigantic, sword-like gypsum crystals. It is 300m underground in the Naica Mine in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It was discovered by two brothers drilling for lead and silver.  The enormous crystals are believed to have formed when gypsum-saturated groundwater flowed through the caves, and was heated and cooled by hot magma below. Some of the largest crystals may be over 500,000 years old.  **San Andreas Fault, California**  This is one giant fracture on the earth's crust, nearly 1,300 km long. The fault line began forming over 30 million years ago when two massive tectonic plates \u2013 the Pacific and North American \u2013 collided.

Among eastern European, former-Communist countries, Poland has been the biggest education success story - following modernising reforms launched at the end of the 1990s.  It has also been more successful than most countries at one of the holy grails for education reform, equality of opportunity.  Poland's schools are succeeding, more than many others, in narrowing the gap between the weak and the strong, the gifted and the challenged.  No other European country has climbed the international education tables quite so consistently as this nation, which emerged so recently from decades of totalitarian rule and economic hardship.  ## More for less  The most recent test results from the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) show that Poland is ranked 14th for reading, ahead of the USA, Sweden, France and Germany - and well ahead of the UK in 25th.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Warsaw 1981: The roots of education reforms go back to the hardship of martial law  While media attention focused on the scorching performances of Pisa chart- toppers such as regions of China and South Korea, it was Poland's success which perhaps offered the more relevant lessons to the struggling post- industrial economies of western Europe.  So what is it that Poland has been doing so well?  The OECD points out that Poland's reforms have raised performance to the same or higher levels as those of the USA and Norway, \"despite spending less than half of what those countries spend on education\".  But if throwing money at schools was not the answer, what is?  Dr Michal Federowicz, director of Poland's Education Research Institute in Warsaw, traces the roots of this success back to the dark years of martial law after the Solidarity era ended in 1981, when, as he put it, \"educated people were suppressed\".  For most of the 1980s, he said, Poland turned its back on education - so that when democracy finally arrived in 1990, a massive appetite for change in economic, cultural life was released. This soon translated into demands for better education.  ## Soviet curriculum  Initial reforms in the early 1990s concentrated on stripping out the ideological content of the old Soviet-influenced curriculum. But it was not until the 1999 education act that deeper structural changes were approved.  Image copyright Other Image caption Zbigniew Marciniak introduced successful structural changes when he was an education minister  The act was radical. Poland's elementary school tier was to be reduced from eight to six years, but with a new three-year \"junior high\" or \"gymnasium\" tier tacked on, covering ages 13 to 16 years olds.  This gave all pupils a crucial extra year before having to decide on their paths into higher education or vocational training.  \"The political will was there to achieve substantial changes in the quality of education and other public services,\" said Dr Federowicz.  \"But the changes couldn't have happened without comprehensive reforms of the structure of local government itself, which resulted in more local autonomy.\"  Poland's former deputy minister of education and higher education, Professor Zbigniew Marciniak, identified factors beyond political and economic imperatives.  \"It was the spirit of the people. The effort that parents and families put in for their kids to continue at school\u2026 society did it for us, we just created the conditions.\"  While decentralised decision-making was vital, government intervention was required in the poorer rural areas, as well as in formulation of nationally- standardised exams and teacher-training.  ## 'Scale of problem'  In fact, Poland used the Pisa test information from 2000 to help pull itself up.  \"We knew we had problems - but the first Pisa measurement showed us the scale of the problems,\" said Professor Marciniak.  ## POLAND'S REPORT CARD  Image copyright AP    * Modernising reforms launched in 1999   * University student numbers increased five-fold   * Among most improved countries in international school league tables   * Spends less on education than countries it has overtaken  It helped to reveal one of the biggest failings of the old system - \"Grade Eight syndrome\", whereby half the school population ditched academic study at 15.  \"Pisa showed that a lot of those kids forgot all they learnt in elementary school... and the most dramatic thing was they couldn't learn any more.\"  The next round of Pisa in 2003 coincided with the first cohort completing the first three-year junior high cycle. \"We got a great improvement,\" Professor Marciniak added.  \"Not to over-estimate, we were starting from a very low level, but the decision to mix these weaker kids with all others, all going through a longer general education, was working, the outcomes were really surprising. But very pleasant for us.\"  The weaker pupils did better and the strongest ones carried on getting stronger.  ## Examining the exams  The break at 12 to 13 years of age also gave children the chance to start afresh, to escape stigmatisation from earlier failures. And the creation of 7,000 new junior high schools led to better teachers.  > It's like pushing a bus - you have to push a long time before it movesProfessor Zbigniew Marciniak on reforming an education system  \"There was a big attempt by teachers to show they were good enough to teach in these schools - they had aspirations, and this was more important even than training,\" said Professor Marciniak.  Structural change was accompanied by reform of the curriculum and qualifications. A new core curriculum is still being fine-tuned, as are the new university entrance exams, the \"Matura\".  There has been a massive expansion in young people going to university.  A falling birthrate notwithstanding, Poland now has five times as many students in higher education than it had in 1999.  This has meant that the higher education system has had to shake itself up to cope with an influx of students from a far wider range of backgrounds, rather than only the most academically able.  ## Soaring numbers  As a professor of mathematics, Professor Marciniak appreciated how far academics had been \"spoiled\" in the past.  \"We admitted only the 10% most gifted. In that context we could really believe all our students were talented enough to be our followers in research, and all our studies were constructed this way,\" he said.  Image copyright AP Image caption Warsaw's changing face: A giant Euro 2012 poster in national colours  But now with student intake soaring, universities have been asked to re-design their courses.  \"The only intervention of state apart from finance, is to create a good accreditation system which would ask, what is your promise to students? How can you explain the real outcome of learning? The rest is in hands of the schools.\"  If the heat of that decade of reform has now tempered somewhat, there are still changes.  Dr Federowicz regards one of the greatest achievements to be the success of decentralisation: \"We proved that local government could take responsibility for education,\" he said.  For example, the government is funding a Digital Schools scheme to provide copyright-free electronic text-books to children in 380 schools.  The scheme, hailed by open learning advocates, was the result of a deal between central government, publishers and other stakeholders.  Professor Marciniak is looking forward to the next Pisa results, which he believes will show Poland making further progress. How much?  \"It's hard to to predict because changing the curriculum on such a scale, it's like pushing a bus - you have to push a long time before it moves.\"  \"But something good is happening - our national exams will show it, Pisa will show this year I hope. If not, then definitely in three years time, we will take the harvest.\"", "newsHeadline": "Poland scores late goals in education - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-18151512", "countriesMentioned": ["Poland", "Norway", "China", "Sweden", "France", "Italy", "United States", "Russia"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "By the end of this decade, four out of every 10 of the world's young graduates are going to come from just two countries - China and India.  The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the United States and western Europe.  The forecasts for the shape of the \"global talent pool\" in 2020 show China as rapidly expanding its graduate numbers - set to account for 29% of the world's graduates aged between 25 and 34.  The biggest faller is going to be the United States - down to 11% - and for the first time pushed into third place, behind India.  The US and the countries of the European Union combined are expected to account for little more than a quarter of young graduates.  Russia is also set to decline - its share of the world's graduates almost falling by half since the beginning of the century.  Indonesia, according to the OECD's projections, will rise into fifth place.  ## Degrees of change  Is this an end-of-empire moment?  Higher education has become the mirror and magnifier of economic performance - and in the post-World-War-II era, universities in the US, western Europe, Japan and Russia have dominated.  The US in particular has been the university superpower - in wealth, influence and until recently in raw numbers.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Chinese parents rent apartments near schools to cut travelling time during university entrance exams  Up until 2000, the US still had a share of young graduates similar to China. And Japan had as big a proportion of young graduates as India.  Now China and India are the biggest players.  Their rise in graduate numbers reflects their changing ambitions - wanting to compete against advanced economies for high-skill, high-income employment.  Instead of offering low-cost manufacture, they are targeting the hi-tech professional jobs that have become the preserve of the Westernised middle classes.  ## Fivefold growth  As the OECD figures show, this is not simply a case of countries such as China expanding while others stand still.  Across the industrialised world, graduate numbers are increasing - just not as quickly as China, where they have risen fivefold in a decade.  The OECD notes that by 2020, China's young graduate population will be about the same as the total US population between the ages of 25 and 64.  Image copyright AP Image caption India will have the second largest share of the world's graduates by 2020, says the OECD  This changing world map will see Brazil having a bigger share of graduates than Germany, Turkey more than Spain, Indonesia three times more than France.  The UK is bucking the trend, projected to increase its share from 3% in 2010 to 4% in 2020.  This push for more graduates has a clear economic purpose, says the OECD's analysis.  ## Enough jobs?  Shifting from \"mass production to knowledge economy occupations\" means improved employment rates and earnings - so there are \"strong incentives\" for countries to expand higher education.  But will there be enough graduate jobs to go round?  Image copyright AP Image caption Ballpark figures: The US has been the university superpower in the post-World-War-II era  The OECD has tried to analyse this by looking at one aspect of the jobs market - science and technology-related occupations.  These jobs have grown rapidly - and the report suggests it is an example of how expanding higher education can generate new types of employment.  These science and technology jobs - for professionals and technicians - account for about four in every 10 jobs in some Scandinavian and northern European countries, the OECD suggests.  In contrast - and showing more of the old order - these technology jobs are only a small fraction of the workforce in China and India.  The OECD concludes that there are substantial economic benefits from investing in higher education - creating new jobs for the better-educated as unskilled manufacturing jobs disappear.  ## Quantity or quality?  The OECD forecast reveals the pace of growth in graduate numbers. But it does not show the quality or how this expansion will translate into economic impact.  There are other ways of mapping the changing distribution of knowledge.  > Each era has its own distinct geography. In the information age, it's not dependent on roads or waterways, but on bases of knowledgeProf Viktor Mayer- Schonberger, Oxford Internet Institute  A team at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute has produced a set of maps showing the \"geography of the world's knowledge\".  This measures how populations are consuming and producing information in the online world - mapping the level of internet use, the amount of user-generated material in Google, concentrations of academic activity and the geographical focus of Wikipedia articles.  And in contrast to the rise of the Asian economies, this tells a story of continuing Western cultural dominance.  \"In raw numbers of undergraduates and PhDs, the Asian economies are racing ahead,\" says Prof Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, from the Oxford Internet Institute.  \"But what's interesting is how the West persists in its positions of strength - because the West controls the institutions.  ## Mapping a new world  \"There are more students in China than ever before - but they still use Western mechanisms to publish results, they accept the filters,\" says Prof Mayer-Schonberger.  Image copyright Oxford Internet Institute Image caption In Oxford's world map of internet users, Europe is bigger than Africa  \"The big question will be whether the Chinese researchers can be as insightful as their Western counterparts - we don't know yet.\"  The maps also reveal how much Africa and South America are losing out in this new scramble for digital power.  Prof Mayer-Schonberger said he was \"completely shocked\" at the extent of the imbalance.  Another feature of the Oxford study is to show how research bases and their spin-out economic activity are clustered into relatively small areas.  In the US, says Prof Mayer-Schonberger, there is hugely disproportionate investment around Silicon Valley and the Boston area, with large tracts of \"wasteland\" between.  \"Each era has its own distinct geography. In the information age, it's not dependent on roads or waterways, but on bases of knowledge.  \"This is a new kind of industrial map.

His vessel, the _Deepsea Challenger_, looked a bit like a lime-green cigar. Over the course of two and a half hours, Cameron piloted the submersible down to a depth of 10,898 m, setting a new world record for a solo descent. He had reached the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench.  Cameron was only the third person to look upon the desolate, almost lunar landscape at the bottom of the trench. Fortunately for the rest of us, he took 3D Hi-Definition cameras with him on the dive. The films he captured show that remarkable sea life exists all the way to the bottom. They are being pored over by scientists around the world, in a bid to figure out what it takes to live in the ocean's depths.  Cameron's dive is the latest step in a 200-year journey to the deepest depths of the sea, the last unexplored frontier on Earth. At the bottom of trenches like the Mariana, the water is freezing cold, there is no light, and the pressure is pulverising. Yet somehow, life endures, and we are only just beginning to learn how it does so.  Until the late 1800s, little was known about the oceans. Folklores and myths conjured up images of terrifying sea monsters like the Norwegian kraken, and the science fiction author Jules Verne imagined that the heart of the ocean could contain \"huge specimens of life from another age\". But most scientists thought the darkness and cold would make the deep sea uninhabitable.  > The deeper he looked, the fewer organisms he discovered  The idea that the deeps were a muddy desert devoid of life had been around for centuries. The Greek philosopher Socrates, who lived 2400 years ago, apparently said: \"Everything is corroded by the brine, and there is no vegetation worth mentioning, and scarcely any degree of perfect formation, but only caverns and sand and measureless mud, and tracts of slime.\"  In the Victorian era, this idea was championed by a scientist called Edward Forbes. He dredged the Aegean Sea and found that the deeper he looked, the fewer organisms he discovered. He concluded that life ceased to exist beyond 550 m.  In a book published in 1859, the year Darwin published _On the Origin of Species_, Forbes wrote: \"As we descend deeper and deeper in this region, its inhabitants become more and more modified, and fewer and fewer, indicating our approach towards an abyss where life is either extinguished, or exhibits but a few sparks to mark its lingering presence.\" He was confident, but five years later Forbes' ideas were blown out of the water.  Father-and-son naturalists Michael and Georg Ossian Sars spent years dredging Norway's fjords. Then in 1864 they brought the first living sea lilies to shore, from 10,000 ft (3000m) down. Sea lilies look like flowers, hence the name, but are actually animals. Each has a stalk that attaches it to the sea bottom, and many feather-like arms that guide small particles of food into their mouths.  > There was just beginning to appear a rich and in many respects peculiar deep sea Fauna  The discovery of the sea lilies sent a wave of excitement through the scientific community. They were thought to have gone extinct millions of years ago, and looked like remnants of a lost, ancient world.  They also showed that the deeps were inhabited. Many years later, Georg wrote: \"So far was I from observing any sign of diminished intensity in this animal life at increased depths, that it seemed, on the contrary, as if there was just beginning to appear a rich and in many respects peculiar deep sea Fauna, of which only a very incomplete notion had previously existed.\"  The idea that ancient life forms had endured at the bottom of the sea was too tempting to ignore.  British scientists now took the lead. Britain's Empire wanted to rule the waves, so it needed to know what was beneath them.  Between 1872 and 1876, the British ship _HMS Challenger_ sailed for 127,653 km in a bid to catalogue the life in all the Earth's oceans and seas. It was a journey into the unknown, just like the Apollo Moon landings in the 20th century. In total 4,700 new species of marine animals were discovered, including the first records of deep-sea organisms.  > The expedition discovered the ocean's deepest point  The animals discovered were extraordinary. The chief scientist Sir Charles Wyville Thomson described a hydroid, a stalk-shaped animal with tentacles, found in the north Pacific. It was \"a giant of its order, with a stem upwards of 7 feet high, and a head nearly a foot across the crown of expanded tentacles.\"  But just as important, the Challenger team studied the landscape of the ocean floor. Thomson described \"gently undulating plains, extending for over a hundred millions of square miles at a depth of 2500 fathoms beneath the surface of the sea, and presenting like the land their local areas of secular elevation or depression, and centres of more active volcanic disturbance.\"  The expedition also discovered the ocean's deepest point. South of Japan, there is a crescent-shaped canyon called the Mariana Trench, and at its southern end the sea bed seemingly falls away. In 1875 Thomson and his team recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8,184 m). Now we know it goes at least 10,916m down. This near-bottomless pit is called the Challenger Deep, after the ship.  Almost a century later, humans went to the bottom of the Challenger Deep. On 23 January 1960, oceanographer Jacques Piccard and Lieutenant Don Walsh of the US Navy piloted a submersible called _Trieste_ into the Deep.  > It now seems the deeps are teeming with life  The descent took four hours and 47 minutes. Most of the ship was taken up with floats and water ballast tanks, so Piccard and Walsh found themselves in a 7 -ft-wide spherical cabin attached to the underside, with a small Plexiglas window. They were, to put it mildly, cramped. Once they reached the bottom, they couldn't take any photographs due to the disturbed silt.  Regardless, the debate about whether life could exist at the bottom was settled. The Trieste's floodlights illuminated a creature that Piccard thought was a flatfish, but is now thought to have been a sea cucumber. \"Here, in an instant, was the answer,\" Piccard wrote in a book about his journey.  It now seems the deeps are teeming with life. In late 2014, Jeffrey Drazen of the\u00a0University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa in Honolulu led an expedition to the Mariana Trench. His team used five remotely-operated vehicles to explore the deepest parts of the trench, as well as along the trench walls. He was surprised by the amount and diversity of life on the walls of the trench.  The first challenge animals encounter as they move deeper is the complete darkness. Some deep-sea fishes, like the stout blacksmelt, have giant eyes to capture the faintest glimmers. Others have abandoned vision. The tripodfish, named for its elongated fins that allow it to perch on the sea floor, relies on touch and vibrations to sense its prey. Still others emit their own light by a process known as bioluminescence. These lights can be used as headlights, as in lanternfish, or to attract mates or prey.  > Occasionally the scavengers are treated to a dead whale  The darkness also causes a second problem. Lack of sunlight means no algae or plants to support the food chain, so food is scarce. Deep-sea animals must survive on the decaying scraps of dead organisms from the upper layers of the ocean, which sink to the bottom. A rich supply of this stuff might account for the rich ecosystem Drazen found in the Mariana Trench. \"It is possible that the trenches are funnelling detritus food down,\" he says.  Occasionally the scavengers are treated to a dead whale, which provides an enormous feast. Hagfish burrow into such carcasses and eat them from the inside out, while boneworms eat the bones themselves. And there are hunters, too: the ping-pong tree sponge uses sharp spikes to impale its prey.  But it's the physical properties of the deep sea that make it lethal. It is frigid: in most places, temperatures are between -1 and 4\u2070C. Worse, the pressure is a crushing eight tonnes per square inch, about a thousand times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. It's like being crushed to death in a freezer.  This combination of pressure and cold has strange effects on animals' bodies. All animal cells are surrounded by fatty membranes, which must stay liquid to transmit nerve signals and shuttle materials in and out of cells. But under these conditions, they would solidify.  \"The extreme cold and high pressures of the ocean trenches would make the fat in your cell membranes solid, just like butter in a refrigerator,\" says Drazen. So deep-sea animals must adapt their membranes to keep them liquid. They do this by having lots of unsaturated fats \u2013 the group of chemicals that includes vegetable oil - in their membranes. These remain liquid at low temperatures and keep the membranes loose.  It's not just cell membranes. Pressure also has a crippling effect on proteins, the huge molecules that do much of the work in our cells, such as breaking down food for energy. To function, proteins must be free to change their size and shape, for instance becoming larger. This is difficult under pressure, says Drazen. \"A simple analogy is blowing up a balloon. It's easy in air, but try doing it at the bottom of a swimming pool.\"  **Fishy chemicals**  To keep their proteins from conking out, deep-sea animals collect small organic molecules called piezolytes in their cells. These piezolytes bind tightly to water molecules, which gives the proteins more space and stops water being forced into the proteins' interiors and distorting them. The deeper an animal lives, the more piezolytes they tend to have in their cells. One piezolyte, TMAO, gives fish their \"fishy\" smell. TMAO increases with depth, so deep-sea fish taste fishier than shallow fish.  > Drazen's expedition discovered the world's deepest fish living 8145 m down  But there's a limit to this. As animals take in more piezolytes, their cells become saltier. Around 8200m down, Drazen has calculated, the cells would be as salty as the surrounding water. Any more piezolytes and seawater would rush into their cells, bursting them.  In line with this, Drazen's 2014 expedition discovered the world's deepest fish living 8145 m down. The new record-holder is a snailfish with a bulbous head and partly transparent body. Drazen believes that this is about as deep as any fish can go. If he's right, there are no fish at the bottom of the Challenger Deep.  But there's plenty more than fish in the sea. Despite the lethal conditions, James Cameron's dive revealed a plethora of animals at the bottom of the ocean. For most people, they are utterly unfamiliar.  The submersible's cameras picked up crustaceans called amphipods, which look a lot like shrimp. But whereas most of the ocean's amphipods are around 3cm long, those in the Challenger Deep were over a foot long. They are the deepest examples of \"gigantism\" captured in the deep ocean. A piezolyte called scyllo- inositol was found in their cells, and may help them survive the pressure.  The animals that appeared most frequently on the tapes were foraminifera: giant single-celled organisms a bit like oversized amoebas. Foraminifera are little-known, but incredibly common. They live in the sediment on sea beds throughout the world, including some thoroughly inhospitable places.  Normally, foraminifera build hard shells of calcium carbonate to protect themselves. Then they can poke out their long, sticky arms and snag food. However the intense pressures at the bottom of Challenger Deep dissolve minerals, so they can't build their shells.  **Amoebas in glass houses**  Instead they have adapted by building soft shells from proteins, organic polymers and even sand. Grains of sand are made from silicon dioxide, the main constituent of glass, and can withstand intense pressures. One group of foraminifera, known as xenophyophores, have taken advantage of this when building their shells. By gluing sand from ocean sediments, cast-off shells, and microbial skeletons to their own faeces, they can make pressure-proof shells. There could be 50 or even 100 species of xenophyophores in the Challenger Deep, according to Natalya Gallo of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who has examined Cameron's footage.  The footage also revealed what looked like a series of sticks buried in the sand. But scientists soon realised that they were sea cucumbers: worm-like creatures with leathery bodies and clusters of tentacles near their mouths. The Challenger Deep sea cucumbers had all oriented their bodies in exactly the same direction, something never before seen, possibly to ensure that they picked up as much food as possible from the currents.  But despite all these discoveries, the biggest breakthroughs might come from organisms that were invisible even to Cameron's hi-definition cameras: bacteria.  Even before Cameron went down, it was clear that the Mariana Trench was home to plenty of microorganisms. Douglas Bartlett of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, who was in charge of the scientific side of Cameron's dive, has found clumps of bacteria attached to rocks in the Sirena Deep, east of Challenger Deep. His team is now examining them to find out how they survive.  > Europa may be our best bet for finding alien life in our solar system  Their analysis of the bacteria's genes shows that they can feed off reduced sulphur and carbon dioxide. Others may feed on gases like methane and hydrogen, which are belched out of the sea bed when the tectonic plates on either side of the Mariana Trench move against one another. Such deep-sea environments are one of the main contenders for the birthplace of life on Earth. As a result, the bacteria of the Mariana Trench could help us understand how life began.  They may also help us figure out where to find life on other worlds. The conditions in the Challenger Deep are nothing like the familiar surface layers of the ocean, but they are quite comparable to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Europa has an icy exterior under which is thought to lie a hidden, liquid ocean with twice as much water as Earth's. Europa may be our best bet for finding alien life in our solar system, as there may be active volcanoes on the sea bed where bacteria could survive. Surely, the argument goes, if they can survive in the Challenger Deep, Europa can't be that much harder.  When James Cameron got back to the surface, he said that \"in the space of one day, [he] had gone to another planet and come back\". It was an apt line. His expedition and others like it will not only tell us about the extremes of life on our own planet, but may help us find life on others.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - What does it take to live at the bottom of the ocean?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150129-life-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "Japan", "Norway", "French Southern Territories", "Australia", "United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Argentina", "Brazil"], "author": "Jasmin Fox-Skelly"},{"newsText": "Evolution is one of the greatest theories in all of science.

As organisms compete for food and mates, those with the advantageous traits produce more offspring, while those with unhelpful traits may not produce any. So within a given population, advantageous traits become common and unhelpful ones disappear.  Given enough time, these changes mount up and lead to the appearance of new species and new types of organism, one small change at a time. Step by step, worms became fish, fish came onto land and developed four legs, those four- legged animals grew hair and \u2013 eventually \u2013 some of them started walking around on two legs, called themselves \"humans\" and discovered evolution.  This can be hard to believe. It's one thing to realise that you are not identical to our parents: perhaps your hair is a different colour, or you are taller, or have a more cheerful nature. But it is much harder to accept that you are descended, through countless generations, from a worm.  Plenty of people certainly don't accept this. But forget all the drama for a moment. Instead, begin as Charles Darwin did: on your doorstep.  Darwin's book _On the Origin of Species_, first published in 1859, begins by asking the reader to look around at the familiar. Not unexplored tropical islands or faraway jungles, but the farmyard and garden. There, you can easily see that organisms pass on characteristics to their offspring, changing the nature of that organism over time.  > These changes from generation to generation are called \"descent with modification\"  Darwin was highlighting the process of cultivation and breeding. For generations, farmers and gardeners have purposefully bred animals to be bigger or stronger, and plants to yield more crops.  Breeders work just like Darwin imagined evolution worked. Suppose you want to breed chickens that lay more eggs. First you must find those hens that lay more eggs than the others. Then you must hatch their eggs, and ensure that the resulting chicks reproduce. These chicks should also lay more eggs.  If you repeat the process with each generation, eventually you'll have hens that lay far more eggs than wild chickens do. A female jungle fowl \u2013 the closest wild relative of the domestic chicken \u2013 might lay 30 eggs in a year, whereas farm hens may well produce ten times as many.  These changes from generation to generation are called \"descent with modification\".  > Our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification  A young chick will in many ways be similar to its parents: it will be recognisably a chicken, and definitely not an aardvark, and it will probably be more similar to its parents than it is to other chickens. But it won't be identical.  \"That's what evolution is,\" says Steve Jones of University College London in the UK. \"It's a series of mistakes that build up.\"  You might think that breeding can only make a few changes, but there seems to be no end to it. \"No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation,\" wrote Darwin. \"Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.\"  Breeding, Darwin argued, is essentially evolution under human supervision. It shows us that the tiny changes from generation to generation can add up. \"It's inevitable,\" says Jones. \"It's bound to happen.\"  Still, it's quite a step from carefully breeding chickens that lay more eggs to the natural evolution of new species. According to evolutionary theory, those chickens are ultimately descended from dinosaurs, and if you go further back, from fish.  The answer is simply that evolution takes a long time to make big changes. To see evidence of that, you have to look at older records. You have to look at fossils.  Fossils are the remains of long-dead organisms, preserved in rock. Because rocks are laid down in layers, one on top of the other, the fossil record is generally set out in date order: the oldest fossils are at the bottom.  > I always think that the most convincing case for evolution is in the fossil record  Running through the fossil record makes it clear that life has changed over time.  The oldest fossils of all are the remains of single-celled organisms like bacteria, with more complicated things like animals and plants only appearing much later. Among the animal fossils, fish appear much earlier than amphibians, birds or mammals. Our closest relatives the apes are only found in the shallowest \u2013 youngest \u2013 rocks.  \"I always think that the most convincing case for evolution is in the fossil record,\" says Jones. \"It's noticeable that one page in every six in the _Origin of Species_ is to do with the fossil record. [Darwin] knew that that was an irrefutable case that evolution had taken place.\"  > How do we really know that one species evolved into another?  By carefully studying fossils, scientists have been able to link many extinct species with ones that survive today, sometimes indicating that one descended from another.  For example, in 2014 researchers described the fossils of a 55-million year old carnivore called _Dormaalocyon_, which may be a common ancestor of all today's lions, tigers and bears. The shapes of _Dormaalocyon_'s teeth gave it away.  Still, you may not be convinced. Those animals may all have similar teeth, but lions, tigers and _Dormaalocyons_ are still distinct species. How do we really know that one species evolved into another?  The fossil record is only so much help here, because it is incomplete. \"If you look at most fossil records, what you actually see is one form that lasts quite a long time and then the next bunch of fossils that you've got is quite different from what you had before,\" says Jones.  > It is also possible to observe the evolution of a new species as it happens  But as we have dug up more and more remains, a wealth of \"transitional fossils\" has been discovered. These \"missing links\" are halfway houses between familiar species.  For instance, earlier we said that chickens are ultimately descended from dinosaurs. In 2000 a team led by Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences described a small dinosaur called _Microraptor_, which had feathers similar to modern birds and may have been able to fly.  It is also possible to observe the evolution of a new species as it happens.  In 2009, Peter and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University in New Jersey described how a new species of finch came into being on one of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands: the same islands visited by Darwin.  > This little group of birds had formed a new species  In 1981, a single medium ground finch arrived on an island called Daphne Major. He was unusually large and sang a somewhat different song to the local birds.  He managed to breed, and his offspring inherited his unusual traits. After a few generations, they were reproductively isolated: they looked different from the other birds, and sang different songs, so could only breed among themselves. This little group of birds had formed a new species: they had \"speciated\".  This new species is only subtly different from its forebears: their beaks are different and they sing an unusual song. But it is possible to watch far more dramatic changes as they happen.  Richard Lenski of Michigan State University is in charge of the world's longest-running evolution experiment.  > It's a very direct demonstration of Darwin's idea of adaptation by natural selection  Since 1988, Lenski has been tracking 12 populations of _Escherichia coli_ bacteria in his lab. The bacteria are left to their own devices in storage containers, with nutrients to feed on, and Lenski's team regularly freezes small samples.  The _E. coli_ are no longer the same as they were in 1988. \"In all 12 populations, the bacteria have evolved to grow much faster than did their ancestor,\" says Lenski. They have adapted to the specific mix of chemicals he gives them.  \"It's a very direct demonstration of Darwin's idea of adaptation by natural selection. Now, 20-some years into the experiment, the typical lineage grows about 80% faster than did the ancestor.\"  In 2008, Lenski's team reported that the bacteria had made a huge leap forward. The mixture they live in includes a chemical called citrate, which _E. coli_ cannot digest. But 31,500 generations into the experiment, one of the 12 populations started feeding on citrate. This would be like humans suddenly developing the ability to eat tree bark.  > All living things carry genes, in the form of DNA  The citrate was always there, says Lenski, \"so all of the populations have [had] the opportunity in a sense to evolve the ability to use this... But only one of the 12 populations has found their way to do this.\"  At this point, Lenski's habit of regularly freezing samples of the bacteria proved crucial. He was able to go back through older samples, and trace the changes that led to the _E. coli_ eating citrate.  To do this, he had to look under the hood. He used a tool that wasn't available in Darwin's day, but which has revolutionised our understanding of evolution as a whole: genetics.  All living things carry genes, in the form of DNA.  Genes control how an organism grows and develops, and they are passed on from parent to offspring. When a mother chicken lays lots of eggs, and passes that trait onto her offspring, she does so through her genes.  > All modern life has descended from a single common ancestor  Over the last century scientists have catalogued the genes from different species. It turns out that all living things store information in their DNA in the same way: they all use the same \"genetic code\".  What's more, organisms also share many genes. Thousands of genes found in human DNA may also be found in the DNA of other creatures, including plants and even bacteria.  These two facts imply that all modern life has descended from a single common ancestor, the \"last universal ancestor\", which lived billions of years ago.  By comparing how many genes organisms share, we can figure out how they are related. For instance, humans share more genes with apes like chimps and gorillas than other animals, as much as 96%. That suggests they are our closest relatives.  > We have a common ancestor with chimpanzees  \"Try to explain that in any other way than the fact that those relationships are based on a sequence of changes through time,\" says Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. \"We have a common ancestor with chimpanzees, and we and they have diverged since then from that common ancestor.\"  We can also use genetics to track the detail of evolutionary changes.  \"You can compare different types of bacteria and find the genes that they share,\" says Nancy Moran at the University of Texas at Austin. \"Once you recognise these genes\u2026 you can look at how they have evolved in different kinds of populations.\"  When Lenski went back through his _E. coli_ samples, he found that the citrate-eating bacteria had several changes to their DNA that the other bacteria didn't. These changes are called mutations.  > Lenski's E. coli show us that evolution can give organisms radically new abilities  Some of them had happened long before the bacteria developed their new ability. \"In and of themselves, [these mutations] did not confer the ability to grow on citrate, but set the stage for subsequent mutations that then conferred that ability,\" says Lenski.  This complex chain of events helps explain why only one population evolved the ability.  It also illustrates an important point about evolution. A particular evolutionary step may seem extremely unlikely, but if there are enough organisms being pushed to take it, one of them probably will \u2013 and it only takes one.  Lenski's _E. coli_ show us that evolution can give organisms radically new abilities. But evolution doesn't always make things better. Its effects are often, to our eyes at least, rather random.  The mutations that lead to changes in an organism are very rarely for the better, says Moran. In fact, most mutations have either no impact, or a negative impact, on the way an organism functions.  > Animals that live in dark caves often lose their eyes  When bacteria are confined to isolated environments, they sometimes pick up unwelcome genetic mutations that get passed on directly to every generation. Over time, this gradually hampers the species.  \"It really shows the process of evolution,\" says Moran. \"It's not all just adaptation and things getting better, there's also this big potential for things to get worse.\"  What's more, organisms sometimes lose abilities. For instance, animals that live in dark caves often lose their eyes.  This may seem odd. We tend to think of evolution as a process of biological betterment, of species improving and becoming less primitive. But this is not necessarily what happens.  The notion of betterment can be traced back to a scientist named Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who was pushing the idea that organisms evolve before Darwin was. His contributions were vital.  > What did he mean they wanted to improve? How would you test that?  But unlike Darwin, Lamarck thought that organisms got better at living in their environments as a deliberate reaction to those environments, as though they inherently wanted to improve.  Lamarck's theory would say that giraffes have long necks because their ancestors stretched to reach tall trees, and then passed their newly-acquired long necks on to their offspring.  \"Darwin wrote about Lamarck privately and said his theory is complete nonsense, it's untestable,\" says Jones. \"What did he mean they wanted to improve? How would you test that?\"  Darwin had an alternative theory: natural selection. It offers a completely different explanation for giraffes' long necks.  Imagine an ancestor of modern giraffes, something a bit like a deer or antelope. If there were lots of tall trees where this animal lived, the animals with the longest necks would get more food, and do better than those with shorter necks.  > Animals like giraffes are so striking because they appear so perfectly adapted  After a few generations, all the animals would have slightly longer necks than their ancestors did. Again, those with the longest would do best, so over many years, giraffes' necks would gradually get longer, because those with short necks tended not to have offspring.  The mutations underlying this all happened at random, and were just as likely to produce short necks as long ones. But those short-neck mutations didn't tend to last.  Animals like giraffes are so striking because they appear so perfectly adapted. They live in areas where the trees are tall and only have leaves high off the ground, so of course they have long necks to reach them.  \"That kind of image is actually what confuses people, I think, because it looks so perfect, it looks designed,\" says Moran. But if you look closer, it is the result of a long chain of little changes. \"You realise, oh, it's not designed, it's actually one odd event that might have spread and led to another odd event.\"  We now have all the pieces of evidence that, when put together, show that life has evolved.  > Human evolution has always been a concept difficult for some to stomach  Descent with modification, which is caused by random mutations in genes, ultimately leads to gradual changes and the formation of new species \u2013 much of it driven by natural selection, which weeds out those organisms that are less suited to their environments.  Finally, let's apply all this to ourselves.  Human evolution has always been a concept difficult for some to stomach, but it's impossible to turn a blind eye to it now, says Stringer.  _Homo sapiens_ is believed to have evolved in Africa before spreading all over the world.  > People of European and Asian descent carry Neanderthal genes in their DNA  The fossil record shows a gradual change from ape-like animals walking on all fours to bipedal creatures that gradually developed bigger brains.  The first humans to leave Africa interbred with other hominin species, such as the Neanderthals. As a result, people of European and Asian descent carry Neanderthal genes in their DNA, but people of African descent don't.  This all happened thousands of years ago, but the story is not over. We are still evolving.  For instance, in the 1950s a British doctor called Anthony Allison was studying a genetic disorder called sickle-cell anaemia, which is common in some African populations. People with the disorder have misshapen red blood cells, which don't carry oxygen around the body as well as they might.  > For those people, it was worth carrying the sickle-cell mutation  Allison discovered that the east African populations were divided into groups of lowland-dwelling people, who were prone to the disease, and people who lived in the highlands, who were not.  It turned out that people carrying the sickle-cell trait got an unexpected benefit. It protected them from malaria, which was only really a threat in the lowlands. For those people, it was worth carrying the sickle-cell mutation, even if their children might be anaemic.  By contrast, people living in highland areas were not at risk from malaria. That meant there was no advantage to carrying the sickle-cell trait, so its otherwise-harmful nature had meant it disappeared.  Of course, there are all sorts of questions about evolution that we still haven't answered.  > Their ancestors go back in an unbroken line for over 3 billion years  Stringer offers a simple one: what was the genetic change that allowed humans to walk upright, and why was that mutation so successful? Right now we don't know, but with more fossils and better genetics, we might someday.  What we do know is that evolution is a fact of nature. It is the basis for life on Earth as we know it.  So next time you're out and about, whether it's in your garden or on a farm or just walking down a road, take a look at the animals and plants around you and think about how they all got there.  Each of the organisms you see, whether it's a tiny insect or a great big elephant, is the latest member of an ancient family. Their ancestors go back in an unbroken line for over 3 billion years, to the dawn of life itself. So do yours.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - How do we know that evolution is really happening?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150803-how-do-we-know-evolution-is-real", "countriesMentioned": ["Central African Republic", "Australia", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa", "Czechia", "Israel", "Argentina"], "author": "Chris Baraniuk"},{"newsText": "Living on the peaks of the world's highest mountains is a tough challenge. At high altitudes the sunlight is intense, cold winds buffet you from every direction, and it's difficult to even breathe because there is so little oxygen in the air.  But despite these extreme conditions, life endures. If you climb to the summit of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain, you will find life at every level. Jungles give way to alpine meadows and finally to snow-covered rock, but there will always be animals and plants if you know where to look.  These organisms have made their homes in one of the most extreme environments on Earth. How do they do it? To find out, we must take a walk into the sky.  Between the vertiginous plateau of Tibet and the fertile plains of India rises the most majestic mountain range in the world. The Himalayas are famous for their high peaks, with more than 110 jutting into the sky at 24,000 ft (7315m) above sea level. Mount Everest soars to elevations of 29,035 ft (8848m).  We begin our journey in the foothills of the Himalayas, about 2000 ft (610m) above sea level. The foothills extend eastward for more than 1000 miles (1609km) from northern Pakistan across north-west India and through Nepal, until they meet the Teesta river in north-east India.  > Tigers also roam the foothills of Bhutan  They were once draped in forests, but many of the trees have been cut down to make way for farms. The remaining forests are a sanctuary for Asian elephants and rhinoceroses, which still roam parts of the Tarai region in southern Nepal. The forests are also home to Asiatic black bears, clouded leopards, the goat-like Himalayan tahr and more than 340 species of birds.  Tigers also roam the foothills of Bhutan, and in 2010 it emerged that they venture far higher than anyone expected. Wildlife expert Alan Rabinowitz became suspicious after hearing reports by panicked villagers, and visited the area with a BBC film crew. After trekking to a height of 4000m (13,000 feet), he set up camera traps.  Rabinowitz recorded a wealth of wildlife, including red foxes, jungle cats, monkeys, leopards, a Himalayan black bear, tarkin, serow, musk deer and even a red panda. The cameras also captured two tigers, a male and a female. The spot, which is a closely guarded secret to prevent poaching, is the only place where tigers, snow leopards and leopards share the same territory.  As we climb higher we leave the deciduous forests and farms of the foothills, and enter coniferous forests with waterfalls cascading through them. These gatherings of pine, hemlock, spruce and fir receive almost 80 inches of rainfall each year.  > The snub-nosed monkey's odd features make it look like a victim of bad plastic surgery  A huge range of wildlife can be found, such as the golden langur monkey. Thick fur protects the monkey from the cold. Like many animals in the region, it spends its winter in the lower valleys and follows the snowline up the mountains in the spring.  However, langurs aren't the highest living monkey in the world. That title goes to the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, whose thick fur allows it to live higher than any primate, except for humans. The snub-nosed monkey's odd features make it look like a victim of bad plastic surgery.  Takins and musk deer, famous for secreting a scent found in almost all perfumes today, can also be found among the trees.  The deciduous hardwood forests on high mountain slopes provide the perfect hideout for one of nature's cutest animals, the red panda.  An incredibly shy creature, the red panda avoids predators by living high up in forests at altitudes of 5900 to 13,000 feet. Its dense fur protects it from the cold, and it has hairy feet to keep its paws warm and stop it from sliding about in the snow.  > Red pandas can spend as much as 13 hours a day looking for and eating bamboo  Unlike other mountain animals, which cope with cold winters by migrating down the mountains, the red panda is trapped. It relies on bamboo as a food source, so it can only live where bamboo grows.  Red pandas can spend as much as 13 hours a day looking for and eating bamboo, even though it is full of fibre that is incredibly difficult to digest, and their guts are not specialized to handle plant matter.  In the summer they will also eat fruit and insects, and even steal birds' eggs, but in the winter they may lose as much as 15% of their body weight. They cope with the lack of food and cold temperatures by slowing their metabolism, which is almost as low as that of sloths.  We trek upwards, and the forests give way to alpine dry scrubland. Above that come meadows of flowering plants.  > Mountain carp have powerfully muscular, cylindrical bodies  The plants here grow short and strong, and are experts at conserving water to protect themselves from the dry winds.\u00a0 Although winters are cold, summers are still mild. Shrubs, rhododendrons, mosses and lichens cover the lower shrublands, while wildflowers such as blue poppies and edelweiss cover the alpine meadows.  Highland tribes graze animals on these slopes in the summer, and wild goats, sheep and wolves can be found. What's more, some of the glacial lakes in Kashmir contain fish, such as brown trout and mountain carp.  These have a number of adaptations for surviving in torrential mountain streams and plateau lakes. Mountain carp have powerfully muscular, cylindrical bodies to help them power through fast currents, whilst other fish shelter amongst pebbles and stones to ward off the strong current. To protect themselves from the near-zero temperatures that strike in winter, mountain carp migrate down the hillsides.  Climbing higher**, **the scrublands and meadows give way to windswept rocks. Snow leopards live here, at elevations of between 9800 and 17,000 feet (2980-5180m) above sea level.  > Markhors lock horns and fight for their right to breed on the sheer cliffs  They have thick fur to protect them from the cold, and massive paws to help them grip the rocky terrain. They use the rocky outcrops, ravines, and steep cliffs to camouflage themselves, allowing them to stalk their prey.  The snow leopard's prey includes ibex and a wild mountain goat called the markhor, which has spiralling horns that grow to over 1.5m long.  The steep ravines and loose stones make it difficult to do anything. Markhors lock horns and fight for their right to breed on the sheer cliffs. Any fall would be deadly, and the males often try to throw their rivals off the cliffs. If one does fall, snow leopards give chase, even though they must haul their kill back up the mountain to their lairs.  On the other side of the jagged mountain range, on the flat plateau of Tibet 14,800 feet above sea level, live hot-spring snakes. Being cold-blooded and thus unable to keep heat in their bodies, they ought to be at great risk from the cold. They survive by hiding out in hot springs, a kind of natural sauna fuelled by underground volcanic activity.  > People have also made their home here  Hot-spring snakes are one of only a few snake species that live so high.Their nearest cousins live across the world in America.  The Tibetan plains are also home to square-jawed Tibetan sand foxes. They live in barren slopes and stream beds at altitudes of 9840-13,120 ft (3000-4000m). The foxes make their dens in the nooks and crannies of the boulders.  People have also made their home here, and just like the animals they have learned to cope with the conditions. But it's not just a matter of altering their lifestyle: native Tibetans have evolved.  Perhaps the biggest problem people face when living at high altitudes is the low air pressure. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to enter our lungs, causing a host of problems.  > It is harder to conceive a child high up in the mountains  Humans tend to suffer from altitude sickness at elevations higher than 8000 feet. The symptoms include a lack of appetite, vomiting, headaches, and difficulty thinking and sleeping. In more serious cases fluid can accumulate in the heart and brain, lungs can begin to haemorrhage, and the heart can fail.  Some of the effects of high-altitude living are subtler. For instance, it is harder to conceive a child high up in the mountains.  However Tibetans don't seem to suffer from these problems, thanks to mutations in their genes.  About 8000 years ago, a gene called _EGLN1_ changed at one point. Nowadays, up to 88% of Tibetans have this new variation, which is virtually absent from closely-related people living in the Asian lowlands.  The change in _EGLN1_ protects Tibetans by stopping their bodies from overreacting to the low oxygen content of the air. In people without the adaptation, the thin air causes their oxygen-carrying red blood cells to swell up, which can lead to heart failure.  Tibetans' altitude adaptation has also been linked to a gene called _EPAS1_, which is involved in the body's reaction to low oxygen levels. Rasmus Nielsen of the University of California, Berkeley and his colleagues found in 2014 that no other group of modern humans has the Tibetan variant of _EPAS1_.  Our red blood cells carry oxygen using a molecule called haemoglobin. When people with the common variants of _EPAS1_ travel to high altitudes, they boost their haemoglobin levels too much, says Nielsen. This thickens the blood, \"leading to hypertension and heart attacks as well as low birth weight babies and increased infant mortality.\"  > The Tibetan-specific version of EPAS1 came from Denisovans  The Tibetan variant avoids this. It \"raises haemoglobin and red blood cell levels only slightly at high\u00a0elevations, avoiding the side effects seen in most people,\" says Nielsen.  Tibetans inherited their form of _EPAS1_ from the ancestors of the Nepalese Sherpa people about 30,000 years ago. But Nielsen believes that the variant does not originally come from humans at all.  \"The Tibetan-specific version of _EPAS1_ came\u00a0from Denisovans, a mysterious human relative that went extinct\u00a040,000-50,000 years ago,\" says Nielsen. Denisovans are only known from a few teeth and fragments of bone, and no one even knows what they looked like.  Other animals have evolved to cope with altitude by changing similar genes. Tibetan Mastiff dogs live alongside Tibetans at high altitudes, and were originally domesticated from the Chinese native dogs of the plains. A 2014 study decoded their DNA and found that they also have different variants of _EPAS1_.  Above 4800 meters, the rocky tundra begins to give way to snow fields. Not many animals can survive these heights, but one that can is the mighty yak, which can climb up to 6100m (20,000 feet).  > Several genes have rapidly evolved since yaks split from cattle 4.9 million years ago  The yak has two thick coats of fur that help it survive the cold. Enlarged hearts and lungs help it get the oxygen it needs.  Yaks are so well adapted to the heights that they cannot normally live below 10,000 feet. They suffer from heat exhaustion in temperatures above 15\u00b0C and are very susceptible to disease.  In 2012, researchers read the yak genome and found that several genes have rapidly evolved since yaks split from cattle 4.9 million years ago. They found three genes that are involved in regulating the body's response to oxygen deprivation. Another five genes help the yak optimise the energy it gets from its food, essential in the winter when food is scarce.  Big animals like yaks do have one advantage: their size means they retain heat well. But even tiny creatures have found their way to these heights.  In 2008 a colony of bumblebees was discovered on Mount Everest. At more than 18,000 feet up, they are the highest known insects. In subsequent tests, some of the bees managed to fly in a flight chamber that recreated the even thinner air of 29,500 feet.  > Tardigrades have been found 20,000 feet up a mountain in the Himalayas  Spiders can also be found. Jumping spiders are more often seen in tropical forests and low-lying scrubland, but there are species that live way up high. The small Himalayan jumping spider is the highest living animal in the world, having been found living up to 22,000 feet up Mount Everest. They feed on insects blown up from lower down.  Strange creatures called tardigrades, which are famous for being able to survive almost anywhere, have also been found 20,000 feet up a mountain in the Himalayas_._  Close to the summit, only the most hardy kinds of plants, such as lichens and mosses can grow. One particular type of moss grows at 21,260\u00a0ft on Mount Everest, and is said to be the highest growing plant on earth.  The only animals that pass higher than this level are birds.  Flying at extremely high altitudes is challenging for birds. The forces produced when birds flap their wings are directly proportional to air density, which reduces the higher up they go. This means that unless they flap much harder, birds flying at high altitudes will experience much weaker lift forces.  Despite this, birds do fly high in the Himalayas. Snow partridges are found at elevations of 18,600 feet, but the bar-headed goose goes much higher than that.  > Above this height, no animal or plant can survive  This goose spends the breeding season on the high alpine lakes of the Tibetan Plateau, and the winter months in the wetland of India. This requires an annual roundtrip migratory flight over the crest of the Himalayas, at altitudes of over 23,000 feet.  At these heights, oxygen levels are one-third of what they are at sea level. The geese cope because mutations in their DNA allow their haemoglobin to take on more oxygen. They also have large lungs that allow them to breath faster and deeper in low-oxygen conditions, massively increasing the rate at which their hearts pump blood. Their large wingspan gives them greater lift and reduces the power needed for flight.  Above this height, no animal or plant can survive. Yet microorganisms can.  Bacteria have been found in the atmosphere 5-10 miles above the Earth's surface. Researchers have even found bacteria in storm clouds.  > Despite the hardships and struggle that altitude brings, many animals choose the high life  In 2013, life was found even higher. British researchers sent a balloon into the stratosphere over England, where it collected samples between 14 and 17 miles (22-27km) up.\u00a0 They found a single microscopic alga called a diatom. Those involved claimed it came from outer space, but it seems more likely that it was simply blown very high.  These experiments suggest that we haven't yet found the absolute limit to life at high altitudes.  It's clear that despite the hardships and struggle that altitude brings, many animals choose the high life. For some, like the red panda, their favourite food is up there.

Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 when Prince William was 15 and Prince Harry was 12.  Prince William said taking part in the programme initially seemed \"quite daunting\" but had been \"a healing process as well\".  He said they wanted \"her legacy to live on in our work and we feel this is an appropriate way of doing that\".

It took place while the brothers were having a \"very good time\" with their cousins at Balmoral, the Queen's home in Scotland.  \"Harry and I were in a desperate rush to say goodbye, you know 'see you later'... if I'd known now obviously what was going to happen, I wouldn't have been so blas\u00e9 about it and everything else,\" he said.  Prince William says in the interview he remembers what his mother said - but does not reveal details of the conversation.  Prince Harry said: \"It was her speaking from Paris, I can't really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.\"  Recalling Princess Diana's sense of humour, Prince Harry said: \"Our mother was a total kid through and through.  \"When everybody says to me 'so she was fun, give us an example' all I can hear is her laugh in my head.\"  He added: \"One of her mottos to me was, you know, 'you can be as naughty as you want, just don't get caught'.  \"She was one of the naughtiest parents.

I was completely and utterly awestruck.\"  ## 'Granny Diana'  Earlier this month, the princes attended a service to re-dedicate their mother's grave at Althorp House in Northamptonshire, on what would have been her 56th birthday.  Prince Harry said he had only cried twice for his mother - one of the times was at the funeral service at Althorp in 1997.  \"So there's a lot of grief that still needs to be let out,\" he said.  Prince William, who was accompanied at the re-dedication service by the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, said he keeps the memory of his mother alive for his children by \"constantly talking about granny Diana\".  \"She'd be a lovely grandmother, she'd absolutely love it, she'd love the children to bits,\" he said.  And he joked: \"She'd be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare... She'd come, probably at bath time, cause an amazing... scene, bubbles everywhere bath water all over the place and then leave.\"  Image copyright Martin Keene/PA Image caption The princes, pictured here with their mother in 1992, recall their last conversation with her  Reflecting on the anniversary of Princess Diana's death, Prince Harry told ITV: \"To myself and William she was just the best mother ever\".

They were were speaking to ITV from their home at Kensington Palace where they will unveil a statue of their mother in its public gardens on the 20th anniversary of her death.  Prince William said: \"We won't be doing this again - we won't speak as openly or publicly about her again, because we feel hopefully this film will provide the other side from close family friends you might not have heard before, from those who knew her best and from those who want to protect her memory, and want to remind people of the person that she was.\"  The documentary will be broadcast on ITV and STV at 21:00 BST on Monday, 24 July.", "newsHeadline": "William and Harry regret last 'rushed' call with Diana - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40692457?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story", "countriesMentioned": ["Saint Martin (French part)", "United Kingdom", "United States", "France", "Canada", "Slovakia", "Germany", "Australia", "Spain"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "_This was the most-read story on **BBC Earth** in 2015. Here is another chance to read it._  It could happen to anyone. Maybe you're out trying to find a new habitable planet for the human race, or maybe you're just on a long walk and you slip. Whatever the circumstances, at some point we all find ourselves confronted with the age-old question: what happens when you fall into a black hole?  You might expect to get crushed, or maybe torn to pieces. But the reality is stranger than that.  The instant you entered the black hole, reality would split in two. In one, you would be instantly incinerated, and in the other you would plunge on into the black hole utterly unharmed.  A black hole is a place where the laws of physics as we know them break down. Einstein taught us that gravity warps space itself, causing it to curve. So given a dense enough object, space-time can become so warped that it twists in on itself, burrowing a hole through the very fabric of reality.  A massive star that has run out of fuel can produce the kind of extreme density needed to create such a mangled bit of world. As it buckles under its own weight and collapses inward, space-time caves in with it. The gravitational field becomes so strong that not even light can escape, rendering the region where the star used to be profoundly dark: a black hole.  > As you go deeper into the black hole, space becomes ever more curvy  The outermost boundary of the hole is its event horizon, the point at which the gravitational force precisely counteracts the light's efforts to escape it. Go closer than this, and there's no escape.  The event horizon is ablaze with energy. Quantum effects at the edge create streams of hot particles that radiate back out into the universe. This is called Hawking radiation, after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who predicted it. Given enough time, the black hole will radiate away its mass, and vanish.  As you go deeper into the black hole, space becomes ever more curvy until, at the centre, it becomes infinitely curved. This is the singularity. Space and time cease to be meaningful ideas, and the laws of physics as we know them \u2014 all of which require space and time \u2014 no longer apply.  What happens here, no one knows. Another universe? Oblivion? The back of a bookcase? It's a mystery.  So what happens if you accidentally fall into one of these cosmic aberrations? Let's start by asking your space companion \u2014 we'll call her Anne \u2014 who watches in horror as you plunge toward the black hole, while she remains safely outside. From where she's floating, things are about to get weird.  As you accelerate toward the event horizon, Anne sees you stretch and contort, as if she were viewing you through a giant magnifying glass. What's more, the closer you get to the horizon the more you appear to move in slow motion.  > Before you ever cross over into the black hole's darkness, you're reduced to ash  You can't shout to her, as there's no air in space, but you might try flashing her a Morse message with the light on your iPhone (there's an app for that). However, your words reach her ever more slowly, the light waves stretching to increasingly lower and redder frequencies: \"Alright, a l r i g h t,\u00a0\u00a0 a\u00a0\u00a0 l r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i\u2026\"  When you reach the horizon, Anne sees you freeze, like someone has hit the pause button. You remain plastered there, motionless, stretched across the surface of the horizon as a growing heat begins to engulf you.  According to Anne, you are slowly obliterated by the stretching of space, the stopping of time and the fires of Hawking radiation. Before you ever cross over into the black hole's darkness, you're reduced to ash.  But before we plan your funeral, let's forget about Anne and view this gruesome scene from your point of view. Now, something even stranger happens: nothing.  You sail straight into nature's most ominous destination without so much as a bump or a jiggle \u2013 and certainly no stretching, slowing or scalding radiation. That's because you're in freefall, and therefore you feel no gravity: something Einstein called his \"happiest thought\".  > In a big enough black hole, you could live out the rest of your life pretty normally  After all, the event horizon is not like a brick wall floating in space. It's an artefact of perspective. An observer who remains outside the black hole can't see through it, but that's not your problem. As far as you're concerned there is no horizon.  Sure, if the black hole were smaller you'd have a problem. The force of gravity would be much stronger at your feet than at your head, stretching you out like a piece of spaghetti. But lucky for you this is a big one, millions of times more massive than our Sun, so the forces that might spaghettify you are feeble enough to be ignored.  In fact, in a big enough black hole, you could live out the rest of your life pretty normally before dying at the singularity.  How normal could it really be, you might wonder, given that you're being sucked toward a rupture in the space-time continuum, pulled along against your will, unable to head back the other way?  > You can't turn around and escape the black hole  But when you think about it, we all know that feeling, not from our experience with space but with time. Time only goes forwards, never backwards, and it pulls us along against our will, preventing us from turning around.  This isn't just an analogy. Black holes warp space and time to such an extreme that inside the black hole's horizon, space and time actually swap roles. In a sense, it really is time that pulls you in toward the singularity. You can't turn around and escape the black hole, any more than you can turn around and travel back to the past.  At this point you might want to stop and ask yourself a pressing question: What the hell is wrong with Anne? If you're chilling inside the black hole, surrounded by nothing weirder than empty space, why is she insisting that you've been burned to a crisp by radiation outside the horizon? Is she hallucinating?  Actually, Anne is being perfectly reasonable. From her point of view, you really have been burned to a crisp at the horizon. It's not an illusion. She could even collect your ashes and send them back to your loved ones.  In fact, the laws of nature require that you remain outside the black hole as seen from Anne's perspective. That's because quantum physics demands that information can never be lost. Every bit of information that accounts for your existence has to stay on the outside of the horizon, lest Anne's laws of physics be broken.  > You have to be in two places, but there can only be one copy of you  On the other hand, the laws of physics also require that you sail through the horizon without encountering hot particles or anything out of the ordinary. Otherwise you'd be in violation of Einstein's happiest thought, and his theory of general relativity.  So the laws of physics require that you be both outside the black hole in a pile of ashes and inside the black hole alive and well. Last but not least, there's a third law of physics that says information can't be cloned. You have to be in two places, but there can only be one copy of you.  Somehow, the laws of physics point us towards a conclusion that seems rather nonsensical. Physicists call this infuriating conundrum the black hole information paradox. Luckily, in the 1990s they found a way to resolve it.  Leonard Susskind realized that there is no paradox, because no one person ever sees your clone. Anne only sees one copy of you. You only see one copy of you. You and Anne can never compare notes. And there's no third observer who can see both inside and outside a black hole simultaneously. So, no laws of physics are broken.  > Reality depends on whom you ask  Unless, that is, you demand to know which story is really true. Are you really dead or are you really alive?  The great secret that black holes have revealed to us is that there is no really_. _Reality depends on whom you ask. There is Anne's reality and there is your reality. End of story.  Well, almost. In the summer of 2012, the physicists Ahmed Almheiri, Donald Marolf, Joe Polchinski and James Sully, collectively known as AMPS, devised a thought experiment that threatened to upend everything we thought we knew about black holes.  They realized that Susskind's solution hinged on the fact that any disagreement between you and Anne is mediated by the event horizon. It didn't matter if Anne saw the unlucky version of you scattered amongst the Hawking radiation, because the horizon prevented her from seeing the other version of you floating along inside the black hole.  > Anne might sneak a peek behind the horizon  But what if there was a way for her to find out what was on the other side of the horizon, without actually crossing it?  Ordinary relativity would say that's a no-no, but quantum mechanics makes the rules a little fuzzier. Anne might sneak a peek behind the horizon, using a little trick that Einstein called \"spooky action-at-a-distance\".  This happens when two sets of particles that are separated in space are mysteriously \"entangled\". They are part of a single, indivisible whole, so that the information needed to describe them can't be found in either set alone, but in the spooky links between them.  The AMPS idea went something like this. Let's say Anne grabs hold of a bit of information near the horizon \u2014 call it A.  > Each bit of information can only be entangled once  If her story is right, and you are a goner, scrambled amongst the Hawking radiation outside the black hole, then A must be entangled with another bit of information, B, which is also part of the hot cloud of radiation.  On the other hand, if your story is the true one, and you're alive and well on the other side of the event horizon, then A must be entangled with a different bit of information, C, which is somewhere inside the black hole.  Here's the kicker: each bit of information can only be entangled once. That means A can only be entangled with B or with C, not with both.  So Anne takes her bit, A, and puts it through her handy entanglement-decoding machine, which spits out an answer: either B or C.  > Do you glide right through and live a normal life?  If the answer turns out to be C, then your story wins, but the laws of quantum mechanics are broken. If A is entangled with C, which is deep inside the black hole, then that piece of information is lost to Anne forever. That breaks the quantum law that information can never be lost.  That leaves B. If Anne's decoding machine finds that A is entangled with B, then Anne wins, and general relativity loses. If A is entangled with B, then Anne's story is the one true story, which means you really were burned to a crisp. Instead of sailing straight through the horizon, as relativity says you should, you hit a burning firewall.  So we're back where we started: what happens when you fall into a black hole? Do you glide right through and live a normal life, thanks to a reality that's strangely observer-dependent? Or do you approach the black hole's horizon only to collide with a deadly firewall?  No one knows the answer, and it's become one of the most contentious questions in fundamental physics.  > It would take Anne an extraordinarily long time to decode the entanglement  Physicists have spent more than a century trying to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, knowing that eventually one or the other was going to have to give. The solution to the firewall paradox should tell us which, and point the way to an even deeper theory of the universe.  One clue might lie in Anne's decoding machine. Figuring out which other bit of information A is entangled with is an extraordinarily complicated problem. So physicists Daniel Harlow of Princeton University in New Jersey and Patrick Hayden, now at Stanford University in California, wondered how long it would take.  In 2013 they calculated that, even given the fastest computer that the laws of physics would allow, it would take Anne an extraordinarily long time to decode the entanglement. By the time she had an answer, the black hole would have long evaporated, disappearing from the universe and taking with it the threat of a deadly firewall.  If that's the case, the sheer complexity of the problem could prevent Anne from ever figuring out which story is the real one. That would leave both stories simultaneously true, reality intriguingly observer-dependent, all the laws of physics intact, and no one in danger of running into an inexplicable wall of fire.  > If the true nature of reality lies hidden somewhere, the best place to look is a black hole  It also gives physicists something new to think about: the tantalizing connections between complex calculations (like the one Anne apparently can't do) and space-time. This may open the door to something deeper still.  That's the thing about black holes. They're not just annoying obstacles for space travellers. They're also theoretical laboratories that take the subtlest quirks in the laws of physics, then amplify them to such proportions that they can't be ignored.  If the true nature of reality lies hidden somewhere, the best place to look is a black hole. It's probably best to look from the outside, though: at least until they figure out this whole firewall thing. Or send Anne in. It's her turn already.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The strange fate of a person falling into a black hole", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150525-a-black-hole-would-clone-you", "countriesMentioned": ["Bahamas", "United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Amanda Gefter"},{"newsText": "Imagine the bottom of an ocean. The water is icy cold and impenetrably dark, without even a glimmer of sunlight. But in one patch of the ocean floor, a jet of hot water spurts upwards out of a rocky vent. This water is laced with life-giving chemicals, and around it a collection of strange microorganisms has gathered.  These tiny organisms are like nothing anyone has ever seen before. But that's no surprise, because we're not on Earth. We're 630 million km from Earth, on Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter.  > Antarctica's lakes are the best analogue we have for Europa's hidden ocean  Or at least, we could be. Europa is one of the few places in our solar system where life could exist. It's believed to have an ocean up to 100km deep, ten times as deep as any ocean on Earth, which could contain twice as much water as our entire planet. All the conditions for life may be met, somewhere in those dark waters.  So far we haven't looked, so we don't know if anything is alive down there. But there are clues to be found much closer to home, in an environment that's almost as extreme.  Deep under the thick ice of Antarctica, there are hundreds of hidden lakes. Some of them have been isolated for millions of years. But in the last few years, scientists have started to explore them, in the hope of finding life.  Antarctica's lakes are the best analogue we have for Europa's hidden ocean. So if life can endure the conditions under the Antarctic ice, the odds of finding it on Europa will improve. What's more, knowing how life survives in these hidden lakes will tell scientists what to look for when they seek it on other worlds.  Europa has held out the promise of alien life since 1979, when Nasa's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past it. Voyager revealed that Europa's surface is a thick layer of ice. But there are vivid lines and streaks on this icy crust, suggesting that it has been penetrated by minerals from below the surface.  > JUICE won't specifically look for life, but it will try to find out what Europa's ocean is like  Most scientists now believe there is an ocean of salty water flowing under Europa's ice. In this water, single-celled microorganisms could have evolved, if the conditions are right.  In 2022, the European Space Agency will launch a space probe called the JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) to study three of Jupiter's moons, including Europa.  \"The mission is going to do a fantastic job of expanding our understanding of the entire Jovian system,\" says Kevin Hand, an astrobiologist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  JUICE won't specifically look for life, but it will try to find out what Europa's ocean is like. The first step is to find out how deeply it is buried.  The answer may be: not very deep at all. An analysis by Nasa researchers in 2011 suggested that there is only about 3km of ice overlaying the ocean. That is thinner than many areas of the Antarctic ice sheet. JUICE will use radar to find out if this is true, and map out Europa's internal structure.  JUICE will also investigate what is going on at the bottom of the ocean. A key question will be whether there are hydrothermal vents: jets of hot chemical- rich water shooting out of the sea floor. These vents could supply the energy for life in the ocean, just like they do in the depths of the sea on Earth.  So far there is no direct evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents, but JUICE might be able to help. It could find some crucial evidence drifting above Europa's surface \u2013 if, that is, Europa is anything like Enceladus.  Enceladus is a moon of Saturn, and in many respects it could be Europa's twin. The surface is a thick layer of ice, and it looks like there is liquid water trapped underneath it. That would explain why Enceladus has geysers.  The Cassini spacecraft has found dozens of water jets spurting out of Enceladus, and has even managed to take samples. A study published in March 2015 reports that the jets contain grains of sand, suggesting that the hidden ocean has a floor of rock and sand, and hinting at the presence of deep sea vents.  > Life doesn't just need water. It needs other chemicals  Hand says Europa might well have similar plumes, and JUICE should be able to spot them. On Enceladus they erupt as high as 500km, which makes them easily visible. Europa's will be less obvious, says Hand. Its gravity is stronger so the plumes would not rise higher than about 100km. JUICE won't be able to sample them \u2013 but a follow-up mission might.  Finally, JUICE will try to find out if Europa has the right chemicals to support life. It won't land, but it can study the makeup of Europa's thin atmosphere, says team member Andrew Coates of University College London in the UK. This should reveal something about the makeup of the ocean. \"We expect to be able to see water, but the non-water composition will of be of particular interest.\"  That's because life doesn't just need water. It needs other chemicals, such as carbon and nitrogen, and an energy source to keep it going. Sensors called infrared spectrometers will tell us whether these chemicals are present, says Coates.  The JUICE mission is still a long way off. But fortunately, we don't need to rely on missions into space to understand an environment like Europa. Astrobiologists are paying close attention to the search for extreme life closer to home, in the lakes under Antarctica.  > Places like Lake Vostok can tell us whether to expect life in places like Europa  The environments are eerily similar. The Antarctic lakes are dark and cold, trapped under a crushing weight of ice. And just like Europa's ocean, many of them have been locked away from the outside world for millions of years.  The largest subglacial lake is Lake Vostok in east Antarctica. The water there is beneath 4km of ice and is up to 800m deep. Yet many scientists believe there is life down there, life that has adapted to seemingly lethal conditions.  \"These life forms in extreme environments on Earth help us develop a framework for habitability [of other planets],\" says Hand. Places like Lake Vostok can tell us whether to expect life in places like Europa.  No two lakes are alike. Some have been trapped for much longer than others, depending when their part of Antarctica froze over. Different lakes also have different flows of chemicals coming in and out. So they are a kind of natural laboratory for discovering the conditions necessary for life. \"It's only in this coupled context that we'll understand the limits and habitats for life,\" says Hand.  Antarctica's subglacial lakes were first identified in the late 1960s using radio echo sounding. \u00a0High energy signals were fired into the ice and the resulting reflections give insight into what lies beneath.  However, these discoveries were \"quickly forgotten about because nobody was interested\", says glaciologist Martin Siegert of Bristol University in the UK, who has spent over two decades analysing the lakes. That's because no one thought that these extreme environments could harbour life.  > The lake's water has probably been trapped for 14-15 million years  The turning point came in 1993, when Siegert and his colleagues discovered Lake Vostok. It had actually been spotted by radio echo sounding in the 1970s, but they were able to use satellite data to confirm not only its existence, but its size: 10,000 sq km, making it the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica.  This time, \"folk got instantly excited by lakes at the base of Antarctica,\" says Siegert. Scientists were on the hunt for \"extremophiles\": organisms that could survive in seemingly-lethal conditions. \"[Vostok] became thought about as a potential viable habitat for microbial life.\"  We now know of almost 400 such lakes, but Vostok remains the most alluring. That is partly due to its age. The lake's water has probably been trapped for 14-15 million years, since Antarctica's ice sheet formed. If there is life there, it is ancient. The challenge is getting to it.  Even before Lake Vostok was discovered, a Russian team of scientists was drilling down towards it. They began in 1990, before the satellite studies, says Sergey Bulat of the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Russia. Knowing nothing of the hidden lake, they were drilling for ancient ice that carries records of past climates.  > Bulat says he is confident that one of the bacteria from the sample is from the lake  In 1998, the Russian drilling team almost reached the lake, but technical difficulties meant they had to stop drilling at a depth of 3,600m. After that the project stalled, until in 2010 another attempt to sample the lake water got the go-ahead.  In 2012, after over 20 years of drilling, the Russian team finally breached the surface of the lake. A year later, Bulat's team announced that they had discovered a new type of bacterial life.\u00a0 However, the water they took from the lake was contaminated with drilling fluid, so it's unclear whether the \"new life\" was truly from Lake Vostok or simply from the drill.  It's a tricky problem. The DNA sequences Bulat found have never been seen before, but that doesn't mean much because most bacteria have never had their DNA sequenced. Nevertheless, Bulat says he is confident that one of the bacteria from the sample is from the lake, while the other 48 species were from the drilling fluid.  For now his team has stopped working on samples from this water. They cannot fully sequence the bacteria because of the contamination. But there's another way to get DNA from the lake.  The ice that covers Lake Vostok is actually a thick glacier, which moves across the lake over a period of about 10,000 years. As it does so, water from the lake freezes onto the glacier's underside, forming \"accretion ice\". This ice eventually gets carried away from the lake.  > Rogers has confirmed about 40 different species of fungi and bacteria  Scott Rogers of Bowling Green State University in Ohio and his colleagues have obtained samples of accretion ice, and scoured it for DNA.  They have found evidence of abundant life. So far Rogers has confirmed about 40 different species of fungi and bacteria that he could grow in his lab. Additional genetic traces of life in the ice hint at 3500 more.  \"The fact that there are living organisms in the accretion ice can only mean that there are living organisms in the lake,\" says Rogers. The most logical conclusion, he says, is that organisms are growing and multiplying in the lake, with some being trapped in the accretion ice.  The organisms Rogers found are highly adaptable. They can grow in temperatures of up to 22 \u00b0C, but also survive below 0 \u00b0C.  Some of the bacteria were similar to those that live in hot hydrothermal vents on the sea floor, hinting that similar vents might exist on Vostok's bottom. If they do, they could supply its inhabitants with nutrients and energy.  > If there are fish they must be very tiny  The lake could even support larger organisms. Rogers has found the remnants of bacteria known to live in fish intestines. Does that mean there are fish in Vostok?  Fish need oxygen to breathe, which ought to be in short supply. But Hand says oxygen could be slowly carried into the lake by the glacier. Oxygen could get trapped in surface snow, be buried in the glacier, and finally seep into Lake Vostok when ice melts off the underside of the ice. \"You can think about the ice sheet as a conveyer belt,\" he says.  Still, it would be a tough life. \"If there are fish they must be very tiny, as there's not much to live on down there,\" says Rogers.  We may have definitive answers as to what the lake water contains fairly soon, Russian scientists have again drilled into the lake, reaching the water in January 2015. As of March 2015, a new set of samples are being stored on site, and will be shipped back to Russia in May.  > Lake Whillans is quite different to Vostok or Ellsworth  The success of the Vostok drilling mission stands in stark contrast to the other attempt to breach a deep subglacial lake. In 2012, British scientists led by Siegert tried to drill into Lake Ellsworth in west Antarctica. It's a smaller and shallower lake: 160m deep and under 3.2km of ice. Still, the water has been sealed off for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, the drill they had built didn't work, so the project was called off in December 2012. It was intensely frustrating, says Siegert, but he plans to go back within the next five years.  However, less than a month after the Ellsworth failure, a US team successfully drilled into Lake Whillans. This lake is quite different to Vostok or Ellsworth. It is shallower, sitting under just 800m of ice. It is also only a few metres deep, and is part of a hidden network of rivers and streams under the ice. Water readily flows and in and out of the lake.  The team, led by Brent Christner of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, published their results in 2014. Unlike the Vostok samples, there were no contaminants. The water from Lake Whillans turned out to be teeming with microbial life, with around 1000 bacteria per cubic millimetre of water. For the first time, a viable ecosystem had been found under the Antarctic ice.  > There might be bigger organisms in the larger lakes  While it's not as deep as the other two, Lake Whillans is still an extreme place. It is pitch-black, so the organisms must be getting energy from something other than the Sun.  Christner says they could be eating the sediments ground off the underlying rocks by the movement of the ice. They might not sound appetising, but they contain the chemicals life needs. Christner says life in Whillans is \"powered by dark forces\".  So far they have only found single-celled organisms. But Christner says there might be bigger organisms in the larger lakes, which could have more sources of energy. \"The higher life forms we might encounter are things like [roundworms],\" he says.  Lake Whillans is not an ideal guide to conditions on Europa. It is too shallow, and not isolated enough.  Vostok is better, because it is buried so deep. It may not be as cold as Jupiter's moons, says Coates, but the environment is certainly the best analogue on Earth.  > Drilling into the icy crust of Europa, by remote control, will be even harder  But that doesn't mean the data from Lake Whillans can't tell us anything. The microbes in the two lakes might be using at least some of the same tricks. Christner's team found several bacteria in Lake Whillans that are similar to those Rogers found in the Vostok accretion ice.  The next step is to get an uncontaminated sample from a deep lake, whether it's Lake Vostok or somewhere else. That won't be easy. It took 20 years to drill into Lake Vostok, and the resulting samples don't look great, while Ellsworth has so far defeated us.  Drilling into the icy crust of Europa, by remote control, will be even harder. But that doesn't mean it's impossible. If Europa does produce plumes of water, getting samples from them would be much easier. Those samples could be the key to discovering life on another planet for the first time.  We could then go even further. There are now almost 2000 known planets outside our solar system. Many of these \"exoplanets\" could be habitable, but we don't know which ones. So Coates says we should find out where life exists in our own solar system, then use it to guide the hunt for life around other stars.  _Follow __Melissa Hogenboom__ and __BBC Earth__ on twitter_", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Europa may be home to alien life", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150326-europa-may-be-home-to-alien-life", "countriesMentioned": ["Antarctica", "Russian Federation", "United States", "Japan", "Kazakhstan", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Melissa Hogenboom"},{"newsText": "![Staffan de Mistura \\(left\\) with Bashar al- Assad](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/78905000/jpg /_78905190_f82e556a-6c80-422f-b789-390d8a7d236a.jpg) Image copyright AP Image caption Mr de Mistura backs the idea of local freezes as a way to stop the fighting in Syria  Staffan de Mistura is a veteran Italian-Swedish diplomat who has had a 40-year career with the United Nations, including a number of high-profile roles. Latterly he also served as Italy's deputy foreign minister.  In July 2014 he was chosen by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to replace Lakhdar Brahimi as the international mediator seeking an end to Syria's civil war.  Mr de Mistura's previous UN roles have included UN envoy in Afghanistan in 2010-11, and in Iraq in 2007-09. He was also the UN secretary general's personal representative to southern Lebanon in 2001-04.  His predecessor as the UN's top envoy to Syria was veteran Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi, who resigned in May after the failure of the second round of Geneva talks in January and February.  Mr Brahimi had spent two years in the position, which he assumed after former UN chief Kofi Annan stepped down following six months in the role.  Speaking on Mr de Mistura's appointment, Ban Ki-Moon said the new special envoy would \"bring all his expertise and experiences to this very difficult negotiations for peace in Syria.\" In his Syria role, Mr De Mistura serves only as a UN envoy, not the joint UN-Arab League envoy, as Mr Brahimi was.  ## UN roles  Staffan de Mistura began his UN career in 1971 as a World Food Programme project officer in Sudan. Over the years his work has taken him to many of the world's trouble spots including Somalia, Ethiopia, the Balkans and Rwanda.  He has also served as Director of the UN Information Centre in Rome, Director of Fundraising and External Relations of the UN Office of the Co-ordinator for Afghanistan (1989-1991), and has held a variety of senior posts with Unicef, the UN agency for the care of children worldwide.  Mr de Mistura is 67 and speaks seven languages including colloquial Arabic, according to the Italian Foreign Ministry website.  While working as a deputy foreign minister in Mario Monti's technocratic government, he was sent to India in 2013 to lead Italian negotiations with the Indian government over the arrest of two Italian marines over the shooting dead of two Indian fishermen mistaken for pirates.  Mr de Mistura was born in Stockholm in 1947 of a Swedish mother and an Italian father, and has dual citizenship. He is a graduate of the University of Rome with a degree in Political Science and Development Economics. He is married with two daughters.

Big gas planets can have their atmospheres boiled away by their stars, transforming them into rocky planets that could even be oases for life.  There is a narrow zone around stars where planets may host life. In this \"habitable zone\", temperatures are just right to allow liquid water to exist on the surface. But this can only happen on small planets like Earth, which are mostly made of rock. Larger planets like Jupiter are mostly gas.  > Little stars have big tempers  Red dwarfs are the most common type of star in the galaxy. At less than half the Sun's mass, they are relatively dim. That makes them an ideal hunting ground for planets, which can easily go undetected in the glare of brighter stars.  But these little stars have big tempers. When they are forming, they shine about 10 times as bright as they later will, and can unleash powerful flares of radiation. This \"adolescent\" period can last a billion years, and it can be bad news for life.  The high-energy radiation can desiccate rocky worlds in the habitable zone, blasting away their water, according to a new study in the journal _Astrobiology_ by Rodrigo Luger and Rory Barnes of the University of Washington in Seattle. No water means no life, at least not as we know it.  But red dwarfs' radiation can make other planets friendly to life, say\u00a0Luger and Barnes. \"There are other ways to make planets habitable,\" says Luger. The key, the pair say in a second paper in _Astrobiology_, is to begin with a planet that formed farther away from its raging red dwarf.  > At some point, that planet might actually become habitable  There, temperatures are cold enough for water to exist as ice. Beyond this \"snow line\", planets form from ice as well as colliding particles of dust. The rock-ice cores that emerge can then pull in large amounts of hydrogen and helium gas, forming gas planets like those in our outer solar system.  This gas planet might then get kicked into its star's habitable zone, perhaps by gravitational tussles with other infant planets. Then the young star's blazing radiation will blast off its hydrogen and helium over the next billion or so years, leaving the core of rock and ice.  Now things are looking up. Volcanoes can release gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, creating a new atmosphere. The ices in the core will melt in the warmth of the star, and could form a planet-wide ocean. \"At some point, that planet might actually become habitable,\" says Luger.  This process will only work under quite specific circumstances. \"A lot of things have to come together for this to work,\" says Luger.  For instance, the planet cannot start out too massive or it will hold on too tightly to its hydrogen and helium to undergo the transformation. Gas planets that weigh between one and 10 Earths would fit the bill. No such planets exist in our solar system, but they seem to be the most common category of planet candidates found by the Kepler space telescope, Luger says. The evaporated cores of these planets would weigh no more than 1.5 Earths.  > Almost any planet you can imagine is out there somewhere  It's \"a good idea\", says James Kasting of Pennsylvania State University in State College. \"Whether this will actually happen is harder to answer.\" Luger and Barnes might have overestimated how much hydrogen and helium gas would be lost, he says.  But even if these transformations happen very rarely, there are a lot of exoplanets. \"Almost any planet you can imagine, I think, is out there somewhere\", says Leslie Rogers of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. An upcoming NASA mission called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, launching in 2017, should help reveal how common these evaporated cores are, she says.  That mission, and studies like this, could expand our \"Earth-centric\" view of what makes a planet hospitable to life, says Luger.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Alien planets' boiled bones can become oases for life", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150211-shrinking-planets-may-host-life", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States"], "author": "Maggie McKee"},{"newsText": "_This story is part of BBC Earth's \"Best of 2016\" list, our greatest hits of the year. Browse the full list._  In the early hours of 10 June 1886, Mount Tarawera, a volcano on the North Island of New Zealand, erupted with astonishing force. The explosions may have been heard as far afield as Christchurch, more than 400 miles (640km) to the south-west.  The eruption killed 120 people, most of them Maoris \u2013 native New Zealanders \u2013 living in small villages in the surrounding countryside. But it is not just because of its high death toll that the Tarawera eruption is firmly lodged in the collective memory of New Zealanders. Most people also remember the eruption because it robbed the island nation of a treasured natural wonder: the Pink and White Terraces of Lake Rotomahana.  The terraces were the two largest formations of silica sinter \u2013 a fine-grained version of quartz \u2013 ever known to have existed on Earth. They were located on opposite shores of Lake Rotomahana, situated six miles (10km) to the south- west of Mount Tarawera. And they were extraordinarily beautiful.  The terraces are sometimes even described as the eighth wonder of the world. One was a brilliant white colour, while the other, due to an unknown chemical impurity, was tinged a light shade of pink. Either would easily have constituted a geological marvel on its own merits. But to have two such wonders within sight of each other, and in complementary colours, made the Pink and White Terraces greater than the sum of their parts.  Watercolour paintings from the 19th Century \u2013 particularly those of Charles Blomfield \u2013 offer a sense of their magnificence.  > By the time the eruption died down, sometime around dawn, Lake Rotomahana had vanished  \"It's hard to describe to non-New Zealanders what the terraces mean to us,\" says Cornel de Ronde, a geologist at GNS Science, a state research institute in New Zealand.  Which explains why the events on that cool June morning have become so infamous.  Shortly after 3am, about an hour after Mount Tarawera rumbled to life, the eruption spread to Lake Rotomahana, and a cluster of volcanic craters opened up on the lake floor.  In 1886 Lake Rotomahana was not visible from any of the surrounding villages, meaning most of the locals could only hear the eruption. But by chance, one person, who happened to be spending the night in the countryside seven miles (11km) to the east, had an unobstructed view of Lake Rotomahana.  > The Pink and White Terraces had been destroyed, or at best permanently entombed  Two days later the man, Henry Burt, told a journalist that during the eruption the lake had resembled \"a huge boiling cauldron, bubbling [over] in all directions\".  By the time the eruption died down, sometime around dawn, Lake Rotomahana had vanished. The water had literally been blasted into the air, combining with the erupted volcanic ash to form a muddy sludge that buried the surrounding countryside up to 46ft (14m) deep.  The newly-formed volcanic craters that had blown apart the floor of Lake Rotomahana were still belching out mud and rocks two days later, when the first expedition party arrived to survey the damage.  Not only was the lake gone, but so too it seemed were the Pink and White Terraces. They were nowhere to be seen; the area where they had once stood was caked in volcanic mud. And the white chunks of sinter which some people found mixed in with the volcanic debris did not inspire hope.  The shocking state of Lake Rotomahana and its surroundings after the 1886 eruption led New Zealanders to believe that the Pink and White Terraces had been destroyed, or at best permanently entombed.  > Secretly, some of the researchers were hoping to resolve the mystery that had surrounded the terraces  In the months after the eruption, Lake Rotomahana grew back. Water from surrounding streams began to flow into in the volcanic craters which had blown apart the old lake, gradually forming a new lake four times deeper and covering an area approximately five times the size of the original.  By the end of 1886, the area where the Pink and White Terraces had once stood was under tens of metres of lake water. It seemed like they had been lost for good.  It would be 128 years before the world learned their true fate.  Between 2011 and 2014, scientists from GNS Science led a series of expeditions to map and study the floor of Lake Rotomahana. The expedition was not related to the Pink and White Terraces directly. The team's goal was to discover how the 1886 eruption had affected the geothermal system that had formed the terraces.  But secretly, some of the researchers were hoping to resolve the mystery that had surrounded the terraces since that dark day in 1886. In their more optimistic moments, some of the scientists may even have hoped to find physical remains.  \"I did quietly wonder what we might find in the areas where the terraces had once sat,\" says de Ronde, who led some of the lake expeditions.  But that was dreaming. In the meantime there was important science to be done.  > The team was able to build up the sharpest image of the floor of Lake Rotomahana ever made  One of the researchers' many aims whilst at Lake Rotomahana was to construct high-resolution images of the lake floor, a task which was carried out by de Ronde and his colleagues from New Zealand and the United States. They hoped that by mapping the lake floor in unprecedented detail, they would somehow be able to discover the fate of the lake's geothermal system.  The team obtained the images using, amongst other gadgets, two high-resolution \u2018side-scan' sonar instruments. They strapped these onto a pair of torpedo- shaped AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles), which they then remotely manoeuvred through the lake, travelling 31ft (10m) above its floor, mapping the lake floor as they went.  The team performed the sonar survey in February 2011. In order to cover the almost 3.5 square miles (9 sq km) of lake floor, the researchers directed the AUVs along a series of parallel, linear paths \u2013 each of which imaged a long but narrow strip of the lake floor, almost as if mowing a lawn.  By combining many such scans \u2013 which totalled approximately 186 miles (300km) of scan lines \u2013 the team was able to build up the sharpest image of the floor of Lake Rotomahana ever made.  The sonar images are not what you would see with your eyes down there (which, thanks to the gloom and sediment, would not be much anyway). Instead, the images were in black and white \u2013 the dark areas represented sediment, while the brighter parts generally represented rocky material or gases.  The picture of the lake floor that emerged on the sonar scans was dominated by sediment, as the team had expected. But there were plenty of interesting features on the sonar images too.  > The team saw what appeared to be a long, thin rocky outcrop  Some showed what looked like cracks \u2013 geological faults \u2013 crossing sections of the lake floor. de Ronde thinks these were probably formed during the 1886 eruption.  Elsewhere on the sonar map of the lake floor, the team saw ghostly-looking clouds of bubbles rising from small craters on the lake floor, proof that volcanic gases are still emanating from the floor of Lake Rotomahana today.  De Ronde was used to seeing features like these on sonar scans. He had carried out similar analyses of volcanoes on the seafloor. But on one of the sonar images, taken in the north-western corner of Lake Rotomahana, de Ronde and his team saw something they had never seen before, on a sonar image or on any kind of image.  Jutting above the lake floor, the team saw what appeared to be a long, thin rocky outcrop, stretching for a horizontal distance of around 197ft (60m).  The scientists did not know what they had found. The feature clearly was not a fault: faults are sharply delineated, whereas the mystery outcrop had a misshapen, lumpy appearance.  But it was the location of this strange feature that really grabbed the team's attention. They were in the area of the lake floor where the Pink Terraces had once stood.  > With the eye of faith they even looked a little pinkish  The researchers knew that the lumpy outcrop they had discovered could not possibly be the whole of the Pink Terraces; it was only a fraction of their size. But could it be a fragment? This thought alone was enough to get the scientists' pulses racing.  The team wanted a photograph right away. Sonar was one thing, but to determine whether the feature might actually be a section of the Pink Terraces, they needed to examine it visually.  They had to wait three years. When the researchers first spotted the possible terrace remains in 2011, they had been too caught up with completing the rest of their surveys to deploy their deep-water camera. But when the team returned to Lake Rotomahana for their next round of surveys, in February 2014, they positioned their boat above the possible terrace remains and dropped down the camera.  Most of the photographs the team took showed sediment and not much else. But to be safe, they took thousands. And on two of those photographs, de Ronde and his colleagues found something that definitely was not sediment. It also made them smile.  The photos showed a rounded, rocky-looking outcrop, sloping gently to one side. And the parts that were not draped in sediment had a bright, pale appearance. With the eye of faith they even looked a little pinkish.  This photographic evidence, coupled with the fitting location of the rocks on the lake floor, was enough to confirm it: de Ronde and his colleagues were looking at a section of the Pink Terraces. They had suddenly resurrected a natural wonder.  But the best was still to come. Buoyed by their re-discovery of the Pink Terraces, the team re-deployed the aquatic camera approximately 0.6 miles (1km) to the north-east: the relative location, in the pre-1886 landscape, of the White Terraces.  Amazingly, these photographs showed much the same thing. In the location where the White Terraces had stood before the 1886 eruption, the camera showed a large lump of pale rock.  If anything, this second outcrop looked even more terrace-like than the first. The whitish rock seemed to have the same vertical, columnar texture that is apparent in pre-eruption photographs of the White Terraces. De Ronde likens its texture to candle wax.  The team had chalked up another discovery, and Lake Rotomahana had suddenly regained pieces of both of its famous terraces. They had been amputated, drowned and buried by over a century of sediment, but somehow, incredibly, they had partially survived the eruption of 1886.  The photographs and sonar images showing the terrace remnants are published in the _Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research_.  They certainly were just fragments of the terraces \u2013 only 10% of the Pink Terraces seem to have survived, and even less of the White Terraces \u2013 but that fact almost added to the rarity of the discovery for the researchers.  Technically speaking, the terraces had always been a sidebar to the group's mission \u2013 a romantic distraction, but nothing of scientific substance. But in other ways, the terraces meant a great deal to the scientists \u2013 and to New Zealanders more generally.  > Burt would probably have been amazed that anything at all could have survived  \"I suppose it's a bit like Americans finding evidence for a long-lost Grand Canyon,\" says de Ronde.  At the end of their 2014 expedition, the researchers left Lake Rotomahana for the last time. The group had achieved their scientific goals: they had established that the geothermal system at the lake was still active, and they had produced a bathymetric map of the lake floor that was 400 times sharper than any other.  But they had also helped shed new light on the events of 10 June 1886. From his viewpoint seven miles away, Henry Burt \u2013 the only eyewitness \u2013 probably saw relatively little. The volumes of ash already coming from Mount Tarawera, and the volcanic mud that was about to issue from Lake Rotomahana itself, would soon have blocked his view.  But the new discoveries made at Lake Rotomahana provide a second witness to what happened that night. The fact that only fragments of the Pink and White terraces remain today strongly suggests that the majority of these old wonders were indeed destroyed by the eruption, probably soon after it began.  But Burt would probably have been amazed that anything at all could have survived the catastrophe he witnessed.  _Follow BBC Earth on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

But these are not your typical volcanoes, belching out hot molten lava. They are mud volcanoes, and as the name suggests they are spewing out warm mud \u2013 as well as methane gas.  It sounds pretty inhospitable, and to humans it would be, but these strange volcanoes are home to billions of small worms. These creatures survive without light. But how they do it is only just starting to be revealed.  The story begins in 2009. Scientists from the ArcticNet project were on a research ship, using sonar to map part of the Beaufort Sea, which lies north of Canada and close to Alaska. They discovered large circular structures between 250 and 750m below the surface.  > The team had only a short window before the sea ice became too thick  Changes in the sound waves reaching the ship suggested that large volumes of gas were bubbling up from the sea floor: a sign of volcanic activity. The most likely culprits were mud volcanoes.  These are formed when a vent in the Earth's surface releases gases. Mud flows from the seafloor and forms a cone-shaped mound around the vent. Compared to normal volcanoes, mud volcanoes are much cooler.  In 2013 a team of scientists from around the world decided to take a closer look. They set sail aboard the Canadian icebreaker CCGS _Sir Wilfrid Laurier_ (SWL).  The expedition was one of the first of its kind to take place in the Arctic Ocean. Working in October, the team had only a short window before the sea ice became too thick \u2013 making the area above the mud volcanoes inaccessible and potentially trapping them there.  > The volcanoes are so large that you can only see a small part of them at any one time  The first thing the team needed was a detailed map of the area. To get this, they programmed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) shaped like a torpedo to fly down to 50m above the seabed. Once there, the AUV moved back and forth over the area, much like a person mowing a lawn.  The resulting map revealed five giant mud volcanoes. They were 600 to 1,100m across, and up to 30m tall.  Next the scientists wanted to see them close-up. For this, they used a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) that beamed back a live high-definition video of the sea floor.  It showed that most of the mud volcanoes had remarkably flat tops surrounded by a circular ridge.  \"The volcanoes are so large that you can only see a small part of them at any one time,\" says Charlie Paull of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, California, US. \"They erupt frequently and release gas and mud, which bubbles out onto the seafloor. The mud has a viscous texture like the top of a very thick stew.\"  > The world's mud volcanoes are estimated to release 27 million tonnes of methane every year  The eruptions contain many different chemicals. First on the list is methane, otherwise known as natural gas.  \"The gas coming out of the volcanoes is biogenic methane, which means that it is produced by the decomposition of organic matter and bacteria, and not from oil deposits trapped underground,\" says Paull.  A lot of Earth's methane is trapped below the seabed as \"gas hydrate\", an ice- like crystal of methane and water. Hydrates form when the intense pressures at depths of over 500m freeze the methane and water. When mud volcanoes erupt near gas hydrates, the methane in the hydrates can escape, along with methane from deep underground.  The world's mud volcanoes are estimated to release 27 million tonnes of methane every year, about 5% of annual global emissions.  The Beaufort Sea volcanoes also spew out water rich in dissolved compounds, such as sodium bicarbonate. The water seems to be a mixture of seawater, water from snow and rain, and water from deeply-buried clay.  > The ROV's cameras revealed vast thickets of worms  \"When clay minerals get buried they are exposed to increasing pressure and temperature,\" says Paull. \"The pressure causes the clay structure to change, which results in a release of water from the clay.\"  And then, of course, there's the mud, which spills out onto the cold floor of the Arctic Ocean.  It is nowhere near as hot as a molten lava eruption, and quickly gets cooled by seawater. Still, the frequent eruptions warm the seas, and water temperatures as high as 9.1 \u00b0C were recorded around the flat tops of the volcanoes.  It seems the volcanic activity acts as a beacon, attracting life to the area. Along the slopes of the mud volcanoes and their flat tops, there are vast communities of tubeworms.  The ROV's cameras revealed vast thickets of worms. A small mechanical arm attached to the ROV grabbed some of these worms and carried them back to the surface.  The Beaufort Sea tubeworms are only 7-8cm long. However, they are distantly related to giant tube-dwelling annelid worms that are found near deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Such worms can be 2m long.  > I think it's likely that bacteria living inside the tubeworms are doing all the work  Both groups of worms survive without light, under intense pressures and in water that is often laced with acid and toxic gases.\u00a0 They can cope with a wide range of temperatures. Often one end of a tubeworm can experience near- freezing temperatures, while the other end is exposed to hot fluids flowing out of the seafloor.  They have no eyes, no stomach and no anus. Instead, they somehow feed on the gases pumped out of the volcanoes.  The scientists aren't sure whether it's the methane gas itself that the worms feed on, or hydrogen sulfide, which is made when the nearby microbes oxidise methane.  \"The tubeworms are using either methane or hydrogen sulfide as an energy source,\" says Paull.  The process is called chemosynthesis. The worms perform a chemical reaction, either on methane or hydrogen sulphide, and this releases electrons \u2013 which supply energy.  > The tube worms seem to prefer some areas of the volcanoes over others  \"The tubeworms probably aren't performing the reaction themselves,\" says Paull. \"I think it's likely that bacteria living inside the tubeworms are doing all the work. The tubeworms bring in methane and oxygen, the two things that bacteria need, and the bacteria get to work synthesizing new organic matter.\"  If that is true, the worms are \"farming\" the bacteria within their guts. They provide a stable, chemical-rich environment for the chemosynthetic bacteria, which in turn serve as food for the worms.  Hydrogen sulfide has the advantage that the worms can turn it into sulfur, which they can store much like our bodies store fat. They cannot store methane, and have to use it there and then.  Interestingly, the tube worms seem to prefer some areas of the volcanoes over others.  The worms were primarily found on the flat tops of the mud volcanoes, not on the slopes. The size of these colonies ranged from 10cm across, with only a few dozen worms, to extensive thickets of worms filling most of the ROV camera's field of view.  > In 2000, researchers found tubeworms that took 170-250 years to grow 2m long  The thickets, which Paull describes as \"as dense as grass in a hayfield\", contained millions of worms. They were clustered around old mud flows. This makes sense, because the tubeworms need a steady supply of either methane or sulfide to survive, and the mud flows would provide that  However, there were no worms around the newer mud flows, even though they are richest in methane. One of the volcanoes, which was both the youngest and the most active, was almost devoid of worms.  \"This volcano is different because it is the youngest,\" says Paull. It may be that this mud volcano is so active, and the mud flows on it so young, that the worms haven't yet been able to colonise it.  The tubeworms may simply be growing very slowly.  Some tubeworms are remarkably long-lived. In 2000, researchers found tubeworms that took 170-250 years to grow 2m long. They lived in cold seeps, another type of chemosynthetic environment, around the Gulf of Mexico.  We do not yet know how quickly the Beaufort mud volcano worms grow. But having such a slow growth rate would make them slow to colonise the mud flows, explaining why the new mud flows are uninhabited.  > The whole setup is eerily similar to another mud volcano, on the other side of the world  The speed at which the mud volcanoes erupt and change may also explain why they are, apart from the worms, more or less uninhabited.  \"We didn't see the common hallmarks associated with other methane and hydrogen sulfide environments, such as various types of clams, mussels and bigger tubeworm species,\" says Paull. \"I personally think that that's because the top of the volcanoes are churning over too fast for worms and other animals to accumulate there.\"  You may think it would be a disadvantage for a slow-growing tubeworm to live in a dynamic environment such as a mud volcano, as it might not have time to breed before being buried by boiling mud. However, it is not clear that the eruptions directly harm the worms once they are in place.  The whole setup is eerily similar to another mud volcano, on the other side of the world.  A genetic analysis of the Beaufort tubeworms shows that they are closely related to siboglinid tubeworms living on the H\u00e5kon Mosby mud volcano, in the Norwegian Arctic.  > Mud volcanoes like H\u00e5kon Mosby and the Beaufort Sea volcanoes remain mysterious  The H\u00e5kon Mosby volcano was discovered in 1989 by researchers at the University of Bergen. It lies 1250m beneath the sea, much deeper than the volcanoes in the Beaufort Sea. It is also much flatter, only rising 10m above the ocean floor. It covers an area of about 2 sq km and belches out mud, water and methane from its centre.  Every year, H\u00e5kon Mosby emits several hundred tons of methane. It is thought to have been active for at least 40 years. The methane is a greenhouse gas, but most of it never makes it to the atmosphere, as microbes and tubeworms break it down.  In fact, mud volcanoes like this may be remarkably common.  A study published in 2000 estimated that there are between 1000 and 100,000 mud volcanoes in the deep sea \u2013 plus all the ones on land.  > We are only just scratching the surface of these underwater volcanoes  Yet despite this, mud volcanoes like H\u00e5kon Mosby and the Beaufort Sea volcanoes remain mysterious. We do not even understand why they are so active.  Normal volcanic eruptions can be triggered by earthquakes and shifting tectonic plates. But earthquakes are rare in the Arctic. Scientists took seismic measurements of H\u00e5kon Mosby from 2008 to 2010, and found no clear evidence that tremors triggered eruptions.  Researchers believe that a series of chambers beneath the volcano, possibly reaching as deep as 1000m beneath the seafloor, are feeding methane gas and mud to the mud volcano. Similar chambers could exist below the Beaufort Sea volcanoes.  We are only just scratching the surface of these underwater volcanoes. But now is the time to find out.  The Arctic is warming due to man-made climate change, and many countries and companies are interested in sending shipping through, or exploiting its vast reserves of oil and gas. If we are to protect its unique marine life, including the tubeworms of the Beaufort Sea, we will first need to understand them.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The strange worms that live on erupting mud volcanoes", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151106-the-strange-worms-that-live-on-erupting-mud-volcanoes", "countriesMentioned": ["Canada", "Mexico", "Norway", "United States", "Netherlands", "Germany", "United Kingdom", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Jasmin Fox-Skelly"},{"newsText": "A group of American astronomers says there could be a ninth planet in our Solar System, even further out than Pluto \\- which is no longer counted as a planet anyway. The new world has been aptly dubbed \"planet nine\".  For now, we only have indirect evidence of its existence. It may take a while before we can see it for ourselves. In the meantime, here are the eight magnificent planets that definitely do exist, beginning close to the Sun and heading outwards.  **Mercury**  As well as being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is the smallest planet  Thanks to a series of unmanned probes we now know a lot about it. Its surface is covered with craters, which are evidence of a long history of collisions with asteroids and comets.  **Venus**  Mountains, impact craters and lava flows are visible on this image taken from the Magellan probe. The bright yellow dot is Venus' highest mountain, Maxwell Montes.  Venus is similar in size to Earth, but it has a thick atmosphere that traps lots of heat, with the result that Venus's surface is hot enough to melt lead. For some reason Venus also spins in the opposite direction to all the other planets.  **Earth**  Our home planet is the only one that we know supports life, and lots of it. The above image was taken by a NASA camera on the Deep Space Climate Observatory satellite. It shows a sunlit view of Earth from one million miles away.  **Mars**  Mars may not be the dry planet it was once thought. Scientists have recently suggested that liquid water can be found there. Dark streaks on its surface could be evidence of water flowing down valleys and gullies.  **Jupiter **  Jupiter is by far the largest planet in the Solar System. The above image shows it with two of its large moons, Io (bottom-left) and Ganymede (top- right). Another moon, Europa, might host life.  Jupiter is a gas giant largely composed of hydrogen and helium. It is famous for its Great Red Spot, which is actually a powerful storm more than double the size of Earth.  **Saturn\u00a0**  Another gas giant, Saturn is the second biggest planet at about 75,000 miles (120,000 km) across. Its days are shorter than ours, lasting only 10 hours. It has flattened poles, as a direct result of its rapid rotation.  One of its moons, Enceladus, is a key contender for life: there may be an ocean of water trapped under its icy surface.  **Uranus**  It can be seriously stormy on Uranus, the third biggest planet in our Solar System and the first one that had to be discovered by telescope. It takes 84 Earth years to travel around the Sun.  Uranus is tilted over by 98 degrees, prompting some to suggest that some enormous object once smashed into it and, fairly literally, knocked it over.  **Neptune \u00a0**  The most distant planet, for now at least, Neptune looks blue because of the methane gas in its atmosphere. It is also very windy, with speeds of more than 1,200 mph (2,000 kph).

Saturn's however really stands out. It has several rings made up of ice and dust particles, with a combined diameter of 270,000 km. These rings are quite thin and therefore extremely hard to see from Earth.  Its biggest and brightest ring - dubbed \"B ring\" - is also its most opaque, and often registers black on images taken from spacecraft, such as the one below.  In an attempt to weigh Saturn's B ring for the first time, scientists have discovered that parts of it don't have as much mass as expected. A team found that the more opaque areas of the ring were not heavier.  This was a surprising discovery as Saturn's B ring is not the same throughout, some parts are clearer than others.  Dirty water, for example, is heavier than clean, as it contains particles of mud that are heavier than water molecules. Not so for Saturn.  The B ring also had less mass than was expected. Even though parts of the ring were 10 times denser than Saturn's A ring next door, it was only two or three times as heavy.  The study is\u00a0published in the journal Icarus. To understand B ring's mass, scientists analysed ring matter called \"spiral density waves\". These are tiny segments of the ring created because of the gravity pulling on them.  Each of these waves has a structure determined by its mass - so knowing the structure allowed the team's to determine the mass, \"weighing\" them.  The team found that the B-ring's \"surface mass density\" was between 40 and 140g/cm squared. Roughly speaking, that's equivalent to the weight of a banana per cm squared.  \"At present it\u2019s far from clear how regions with the same amount of material can have such different opacities,\" says Matthew Hedman, the study\u2019s lead author and of the University of Idaho, Moscow, US.  \"It could be something associated with the size or density of individual particles, or it could have something to do with the structure of the rings.\"  Understanding more about Saturn's rings could help determine its age. That's because a smaller ring would attract cosmic dust more quickly because it has less size to fill.  \"By 'weighing' the core of the B ring for the first time, this study makes a meaningful step in our quest to piece together the age and origin of Saturn\u2019s rings,\" says Linda Spilker, of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, US.  \"The rings are so magnificent and awe-inspiring, it\u2019s impossible for us to resist the mystery of how they came to be.\"", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Saturns biggest ring sparks new mystery ", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160203-saturns-brightest-ring-surprisingly-light", "countriesMentioned": ["Russia", "United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Melissa Hogenboom"},{"newsText": "Last August, in southern Iceland, the flanks of the volcano Bardarbunga ripped open and fountains of lava spouted skyward. Molten rock oozed downhill making its way toward the sea. The eruption has now come to an end but the volcano continues to pump gases into the atmosphere. Scientists are still monitoring it closely.  \u201cBardarbunga has really, for the first time, seriously showed its power,\u201d says Pall Einarsson, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland. But, for now, the eruption has followed what Einarsson describes as the \u201cbest case scenario.\u201d Aside from the occasional air pollution affecting eastern Icelanders, its impacts have been minimal and it bears little resemblance the granddaddy of Icelandic volcanoes: Laki.  Laki\u2019s eruption started in 1783 and, for eight long months, it spewed lava and noxious gases. The sulphur dioxide created acid rain that decimated Iceland\u2019s vegetation, and fluorine gas settled on the grass eventually killing sixty percent of the livestock. More than a fifth of the Icelandic population, approximately 10,000 people, died from famine or disease.  But Laki\u2019s devastation spread well beyond the \u2018island of fire and ice.\u2019 The sulphurous haze quickly reached Europe, damaging crops and blocking out the sun\u2019s rays, leading to cooler temperatures. Even in Alaska, the summertime temperatures were 4 Celsius less than the norm and Russian traders noted a population decrease in the Inuit.  Although the ultimate death toll from Laki might be near impossible to estimate, the volcano definitely earns its place amongst the world\u2019s deadliest. It\u2019s a list that includes Indonesia\u2019s Tambora volcano, which erupted in 1815, and Columbia\u2019s Ruiz volcano, which claimed the lives of local Columbians as recently as 30 years ago.  None of these volcanoes wielded their force in quite the same way, and nearly all took their victims by surprise. Does that mean that, with the science of volcanology now being able to predict when a volcano erupts, that deadly volcanoes are a thing of the past?  > Big billowing pillars, or columns, of ash and gas, hot gas, shoot up above such a volcano to huge heights, up to 30,000 feet or so  Economists at Saxo Bank don\u2019t think so. Listed in their \u2018Outrageous Predictions\u2019 for 2015 was that an eruption of Bardarbunga would cloud the skies over Europe and call for a doubling of food prices. Although the bank\u2019s predictions are typically for unlikely events, several previous predictions have unfortunately come true.  If Bardarbunga, which lies partly under a glacier, had erupted under the ice, it would have sent plumes of gritty ash into the sky and furious floods across the mainland. \u201cBut what happened was a very peaceful lava eruption on an ice- free part of the country, where it could not possibly do any harm,\u201d Einarsson says.  But in the decades to come, will Iceland, and the world, remain so fortunate?  **Forces of Fire and Flood**  On April 5 1815, a some 4000 metre high volcano, Mount Tambora, on the island of Sumbuwa in Indonesia, burst into life so loudly that soldiers hundreds of miles away in Java thought they\u2019d heard cannon fire and dispatched troops to repel invaders.  Then, five days later, the real fireworks began: Tambora propelled plumes of smoke and ash thousands of metres into the skies. \u201cBig billowing pillars, or columns, of ash and gas, hot gas, shoot up above such a volcano to huge heights, up to 30,000 feet or so,\u201d says Jon Davidson, an earth sciences professor at Durham University in the UK.  Tambora ejected about 150 cubic kilometres of ash, some of which settled as far as 1,300 km away. In central Java and Kalimantan, 900 km (550 miles) from the eruption, one centimetre of ash fell.  It was the most powerful volcano recorded in modern times - a 7 on the volcanic explosivity index (VEI-7).   The collapse of the eruption column produced numerous burning pyroclastic flows - high-density mixtures of burning rock fragments and hot gases - that descended downslope at great speed. \u201cIf those columns collapse, and we know they do continuously while the volcano is erupting, they are deadly because they are very, very quick,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cYou can\u2019t outrun them.\u201d  Decimating all the villages in their path, the fiery flows plunged into the ocean where the hot-cold mix sent further explosions of ash soaring into the atmosphere. Ash smothered buildings and crops and contaminated the water. Whereas the pyroclastic flows and volcanic bombs killed almost 10,000 people, an estimated 82,000 more died indirectly from starvation and disease.  > It was a potent mix of magma and seawater that made the eruption so explosive. And that blew the island to pieces  And Tambora\u2019s deadly tendrils spread far afield. Its sulphurous emissions caused acid particles to spread around the globe, triggering a global cooling. The year was known as a \u201cYear Without a Summer,\u201d one that led to major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere. Beyond the fatalities from hunger, the cold also claimed lives. In America, the year earned the nickname \u2018eighteen hundred and froze to death,\u2019 and frozen crops spurred many farmers to strike West in search of warmer temperatures.  Less than 60 years later, another Indonesian volcano shook the world, but this time its strike was sure and swift: within one day, more than 36,000 people died. On August 26, 1883, Krakatoa, which lay 1,400 km west of Tambora, jetted out a white cloud of ash and pumice. As the volcano hurled its innards into the air, its underground chamber emptied and, eventually, with nothing to support it, the cavity\u2019s rock roof collapsed. Water then gushed onto the magma - a mixture of molten and semi-molten rock and dissolved gases - and such a cataclysmic eruption ensued that it was heard more than 7,000 kilometres away in Sri Lanka.  \u201cIt was a potent mix of magma and seawater that made the eruption so explosive,' says Davidson, \u201cand that blew the island to pieces.\u201d'  The volcano then collapsed to 250 metres beneath sea level, and two-thirds of the island followed it. Most of the casualties, however, were on neighbouring islands. Following the first eruption, tsunami after tsunami hit the shores of Sumatra, Java and the adjacent islands obliterating villages and coastal communities. And, in similar circumstances to the aftermath of Tambora, sun blocking gases caused global temperatures to fall by as much as 1.2 Celsius.  \u201cEven though it wasn\u2019t as big as an eruption as Tambora, I think Krakatoa had a bigger effect,\u201d says Davidson. When it comes to being deadly, size isn\u2019t everything, he points out.  **Small but Deadly**  A veritable monster of volcanoes, the ice-capped Nevado del Ruiz covers more than 200 square kilometres in central Columbia, stretching 65 kilometres from east to west. But when it came to life in 1985, it issued a mere murmur, an eruption that only registered a 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity index. Not enough to worry the residents of the town of Armero, 40 kilometres away.  \u201cPeople live a long way from the summit because the volcano is so large,\u201d says Don Swanson, a volcanologist at the Hawaii Volcano Observatory. \u201cSo the threat doesn\u2019t seem as immediate as it might be around a smaller, more conical shaped volcano.\u201d  On eruption, the volcano\u2019s heart ejected a molten mass of rocks and gas, which in itself didn\u2019t impact the town. But the heated material melted the glacier and sent a mixture of ice and water careering down the hillsides at 50 kilometres an hour. These landslides picked up ash, rocks and volcanic material to form lahars - volcanically induced debris flows - which coursed into the major rivers at the base of the volcano.  \u201cOne river charged through the small town, and basically demolished it,\u201d Davidson says. In Armero, the lahar killed more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants. Scientists had warned the government that mudslides could destroy the towns, but the inhabitants didn\u2019t evacuate.  \u201cAnd this is the real tragedy of the Ruiz situation. The lahar, of course, would have destroyed the town but people could have escaped with their lives,\u201d Swanson says. \u201cThis was a small, manageable event - it was a very small eruption.\u201d  Ruiz was the second deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pel\u00e9e on the island of Martinique. But only one notch higher on the explosivity index than Ruiz, Mount Pel\u00e9e claimed 28,000 lives shortly after erupting.  When the volcano blew its top, on the morning of May 8, its lava dome collapsed to send a fireball of gas, steam, dust and pumice shooting down the hillside. This pyroclastic flow, thanks to the incandescent gas, is also known as an nu\u00e9e ardente - a glowing cloud. Travelling at more than 160 km/h (100 m/ph), it struck the town of St Pierre at 8:02am and immediately suffocated and burnt its inhabitants. Only three survived, including Auguste Ciparis, the sole occupant of the city's dungeon.  \u201cIt's just coincidence whether or not those pyroclastic density currents head towards an area of dense population,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cIt could have gone down the north side, in which case nobody probably would have even heard about the eruption.\u201d  **What\u2019s simmering?**  For years after the Krakatoa volcano sank spectacularly into the ocean, peace reigned in the surrounding area. But then, in 1927, Javanense fishermen saw steam and debris bubbling away in the water. Soon after, Anak Karakatoa - 'Child of Krakatoa' - began to rise above the sea.  This \u2018enfant horribilis\u2019 has since erupted quite frequently to reach a height of about 300 metres, but Davidson doubts that another massive Krakatoa eruption will happen again soon. Currently, there is simply not enough magma in the volcano\u2019s chamber to fuel such an explosion, he says.  Should another large volcanic eruption hit Indonesia, however, the casualties could be huge, as millions of people live in places prone to flooding. \u201cThe most dangerous volcanoes are, of course, those that are in the densely populated areas,\u201d Swanson says.  If pressed to name the potential most deadly volcano of the future, both Davidson and Swanson concur: \u201cVesuvius is one that I think would probably be at, or very close to, the top of every volcanologist's list,\u201d Swanson says.  Vesuvius, perhaps the most famed volcano worldwide, decimated the town of Pompeii and Herculaneum when it exploded in 79 A.D. Now more than 600,000 people live near its base in what is termed the \u201cred zone\u201d \\- the 12-kilometre radius where people would stand little chance of survival if the volcano explodes again.  But in the battle of man against the immortal, science is proving an invaluable weapon. Volcanologists at the Vesuvius Observatory now monitor the volcano constantly to anticipate future eruptions. \u201cThen you'll have an opportunity to make decisions which can potentially move the population out of the way, \u201c Davidson says.  By mapping back through time to previous eruptions and analysing them, scientists can now begin to determine the nature and timing of future eruptions, Davidson says. \u201cThe more we study the volcanoes, the more familiar they become in the sense that they have, just like people, certain characteristics,\u201d Davidson says.  But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that deadly volcanoes are simply a phenomenon of the past.  There are many volcanoes that haven\u2019t erupted in living memory, and aren\u2019t being monitored, Davidson says. \u201cAnd because we've never seen it, we don't really know what we're looking for,\u201d he adds.  When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, for example, few scientists had been monitoring it - its last eruption had been some 400-500 years earlier. Although many people fled the region after scientists\u2019 warnings, 847 still perished.  And what of the Icelandic volcanoes? As Laki has already demonstrated, these volcanoes wield their own brand of deadliness, spreading noxious gases to the nearby densely populated European countries. Icelandic volcanoes will always give plenty of warning, however, and scientists can monitor air quality so that governments can take the necessary precautions, Davidson says.  Still, scientists will watch closely, should Bardabunga make another move. Einarsson remains cautiously optimistic. It was the biggest eruption for 200 years, he says, but still the damage was minimal.  So even though Bardarbunga certainly had the potential to create a catastrophe along the lines of the Laki disaster, \u201cIt would really be quite far-fetched to assume that now,\u201d Einarsson says.  Let\u2019s just hope it stays that way.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The world's most deadly volcanoes", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150227-the-worlds-most-deadly-volcanoes", "countriesMentioned": ["Iceland", "Indonesia", "Martinique", "United States", "Australia", "Canada"], "author": "Jane Palmer"},{"newsText": "Volcanoes can blast, burn and sear their way to destruction. But in doing so, they can sculpt some unique and beautiful landforms.  **Blue flames of sulphur**  Kawah Ijen, a volcano in East Java, Indonesia, stands 2,600 metres tall and is topped with a large caldera and a 200-metre-deep lake of sulphuric acid. When the lava spills down the slopes it is interlaced with high temperature sulphuric gases. Once these gases make contact with oxygen in the air, they burn with eerie bright-blue flames. These flames give the illusion that blue lava is spilling down the mountainside.  **Mounds of mud**  Mud volcanoes form in places where pockets of underground gas find a weak spot in the Earth. The gas forces its way to the surface, through the mud, to create oozing, gurgling mounds of sludge. Eastern Azerbaijan is home to more than a third of the world\u2019s 1000 mud volcanoes. These volcanoes top out around 700 metres high and around 10 kilometres wide - most of them are around 400 metres high. Unlike typical volcanoes, the contents of mud volcanoes are cold, but they can still be deadly. The gas can build up below the surface and, when finally escapes it can asphyxiate nearby victims and release a torrent of fast flowing mud from the volcano.  **Basalt columns**  It might seem crazy that an event as chaotic as a volcano can produce features as regular as basalt column, but it all boils down to the physics of cooling. When magma - the molten and semi-molten rock that can pour out of volcanoes - starts to cool, it contracts and cracks begin to form. These cracks start at the cooling surface of the lava flow and then propagate into the magma to form stacks of plates, and thereby columns. The columns themselves usually stand perpendicular to the cooling surface, so when the lava has travelled horizontally, the columns are upright.  **Statues of love**  Millions of years ago, volcanic eruptions left a thick layer of hardened and porous volcanic ash near Goreme, Turkey. Over time, wind and rain eroded this layer into a network of deep canyons and sculpted column- and cone-like formations called fairy chimneys. Because some of these rocks look like enormous penises, the region in Cappadocia, Turkey is known as Love Valley.  **Cinder cones**  During an eruption, gas bubbles inside underground chambers can try to expand in all directions, but the only way to relieve the pressure is up and out of one of the volcanoes' vents. The shear force of the gas sends scoria - vesicular, low-density basalt, otherwise know as cinder - shooting out vertically to create a lava fountain. Some of these fountains such as those during the early stages of the Mauna Ulu eruption were up to 500 metres high. Because the material is thrown so high, it cools down before it lands and it doesn\u2019t stick together. Cinder cones are like giant anthills of scoria. If the gases oxidise and combine with moisture the cones can have a reddish colour. If a persistent wind blows during an eruption the cones can be asymmetric.  **Lava tubes**  Lava tubes are tunnels within solidified lava that formed during the time of a volcanic eruption. As lava flows from the eruption, it does so in separate channels and the top layer of each channel can \u201croof over\u201d as the lava begins to cool and harden. The tube then becomes a conduit for fresh lava and the formation of the tubes means that the lava can flow longer distances than it would without them, as it is insulated from cooling. Without the tubes lava would simply have stacked up near the volcanoes vents.  **Hydrothermal fields   **  The Dallol volcano and its hydrothermal fields are located in a remote part of North East Ethiopia, and the spectacular scene there is one of multicoloured white, pink, red, yellow, green, grey and black salt deposits, hot springs and miniature geysers cradled into volcanic craters. Most of Dallol\u2019s hot springs lie on a large mound that was formed by magma pushing upward and lifting the kilometre-thick salt deposits skywards. Groundwater, which has been heated by molten rock, then carries the dissolved salts to the surface. The relentless heat - average annual temperatures climb well above 30 degrees Celsius - quickly dries away the moisture to leave only salt deposits. The salt crystals create sculptures of various shapes and sizes, and a multitude of colours thanks to the sulphur and potassium salts coloured by various ions.  **Volcanic bombs**  When a volcano erupts it can eject large globs of lava, which cool during flight into solid, or semi-solid rock, before hitting the ground. These \u201cvolcanic bombs\u201d are shaped while flying and consequently take quite aerodynamic forms. In flight they can travel long distances and then travel even further when they hit the ground and begin to roll at high speeds. These projectiles are known as cannonball bombs. The bombs can be large - five to six metres in diameter - and move at a rate of 200-400 metres per second. Because they can fly up to five kilometres from the vent of a volcano they can be extremely dangerous to bystanders who believe they are a safe distance from the eruption site.  **Lava domes**  If there is not enough gas or pressure to erupt explosively, viscous lava will often pile up round a vent to create a lava dome. This lava is often too thick and sticky to flow very far. Typically the domes are steep-sided and thick - they can be several kilometres wide. Depending on the strength of the eruption, the slope of the land and the viscosity of the lava the domes can take many shapes. The circular, flat-topped domes are known as Tortas, the circular and spiny domes are called Peleean and the piston shaped lava domes are known as Upheaved Plugs. Repeated eruptions can also build on existing domes so that some domes will take more than 100 years to reach their full size.  **Lava lakes**  When a vent in a volcanic crater erupts, the lava can partially fill the crater to create a lava lake. Alternatively, the lakes can form when the lava pours into a crater or broad depression. The lakes can also form on top of a new vent that erupts lava continuously for several weeks to build a new crater. Lava lakes can be both totally or partially molten, and even totally solidified. Unsolidified lava lakes are rare, however, and currently only five such long-lived lakes exist in the world, although the eruption of Nyamuragira in the Democratic Republic of the Congo volcano in late November 2014, may have birthed another. At the moment the churning lava simply comes and goes in the volcano\u2019s North Pit Crater but scientists believe the lake may eventually become long-lived.  **Rivers of fire**  When a volcano erupts, lava oozes from vents or fissures. Although it can destroy everything in its path, lava typically moves so slowly that people can easily escape. \u201cIf you look at Hawaii, the volcano there has been erupting for ages and basically people just watch the lava flow coming up to a house and then hop in the car and move away,\u201d says Jon Davidson, an earth sciences professor at Durham University. \u201cYou could walk in front of those lava flows and be probably safe.\u201d That\u2019s not always the case though. Less viscous lava travelling in a confined channel down steep slopes will move more quickly. Either way, lava can travel far: the leading edges of basalt flows can travel as fast as 10 km/hour on steep slopes but they typically advance less than 1 km/hour on gentle slopes. When basalt lava flows are confined within a channel or lava tube on a steep slope, the main body of the flow can reach velocities greater than 30 km/hour.  **Calderas**  Calderas - large volcanic craters - are the classic calling cards of volcanic explosions. They are caused by explosive eruptions or the collapse of surface rock into an empty magma chamber. About 7700 years ago, as Mount Mazama in Oregon erupted and poured molten and semi-molten rock into the atmosphere it emptied a large underground chamber. The roof of the cavity then collapsed to produce a massive crater 10 kilometres wide. Centuries of rain and snow then filled the caldera to create Crater Lake, one of the world\u2019s most famous calderas. At 589 metres deep it is the deepest lake in the United States and the seventh deepest lake in the world.  **Pillow lava**  Pillow lavas are aptly named rounded lumps of hardened lava that can be pillow-sized but can also reach the size of a small bed. When hot lava enters water the outer layer hardens quickly to form a glassy skin that surrounds remaining molten hot lava. The pressure of the trapped hot lava causes the shell to stretch and expand like a balloon full of water. Finally the hot lava bursts through the skin to go on to form a new pillow. The pillows can form piles up to tens of metres high and the flows can stretch kilometres long. Underwater pillow lava is very common on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Juan de Fuca Ridge, but it can also be seen on land where lava has flowed into lakes and rivers, or in areas that were once submerged. If the conditions are right, mosses will cover the pillow lava to form a bumpy landscape akin to green bubble wrap.  **Rafts of pumice**  When a large underwater volcano erupts, the lava cools quickly to trap gas bubbles in the rock. This forms pumice, a highly vesicular (or \u201cbeady\u201d) porous rock that is so light that it can float on water. If copious amounts of pumice form, it collects in rafts on the ocean. When the deep volcano, Havre Seamount, erupted in 2012 it created a pumice raft that covered more than 400 square kilometres of water, which scientists discovered in the Kermadec Islands of New Zealand.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - 14 stunning volcano creations", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150330-14-stunning-volcano-creations", "countriesMentioned": ["Turkey", "Indonesia", "United States"], "author": "Jane Palmer"},{"newsText": "Story has it that many hundreds of years ago, Tanovo, chief of the Fijian island Ono, was very partial to a late afternoon stroll.

Enraged at this, and robbed of the pacifying effects of his daily meditation, Tanovo wove giant coconut-fibre baskets and began to remove earth from the mountain. His rival, however, caught Tanovo and chased him away. Tanovo, in his flight, dropped earth at the islands of Dravuni and Galoa.  When geologist Patrick Nunn first heard this myth, it made sense that it described the volcanic eruption of Nabukelevu, with the associated ash falls on other islands in the Kadavu group. But his scientific investigation of the region concluded that the volcano had not erupted for 50,000 years, long before the island was first inhabited around 2000 B.C. The myth, it seemed, was simply a story\u2014not a description of previous events.  Then, two years later, when diggers carved out a road near the base of the volcano, they uncovered pieces of ancient pottery buried underneath a metre- deep layer of volcanic ash. \u201cThis clearly demonstrated that the volcano had erupted within the last 3,000 years while humans lived here,\u201d says Nunn, a professor at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia. \u201cThe cultural memory was right, and our scientific surveys were wrong.\u201d  > You attribute it to supernatural forces and you say it is a battle between the giants and the gods  From prehistoric times to, more recently, the pyrotechnics of Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea, volcanic eruptions have aroused fear and inspired myths. Often cultures have seen active volcanoes as the abode of gods - typically gods quick to anger.  \u201cI think the creation of myths is essentially the human reaction to witnessing a natural process that you cannot explain, says Haraldur Sigurdsson, a volcanologist at the University of Rhode Island, US. \u201cSo you attribute it to supernatural forces and you say it is a battle between the giants and the gods.\u201d  But deities aside, these traditional oral tales can contain valuable information about the type, and nature of volcanic eruptions, Nunn says. In particular they can contribute \u201cmissing data\u201d to geologists about events that happened hundreds or thousands of years ago.  \u201cAfter 30 years of research in the geosciences I believe that the analysis of myths is hugely important,\u201d Nunn says. \u201cIt can help bridge the gap between geological theory and human history and lead to scientific insights.\u201d  **Legend has it**  Shortly after research volcanologist Don Swanson moved to Hawaii in 1997, a friend, knowing Swanson\u2019s love of poetry, gave him a book of translated Hawaiian chants. One evening, as Swanson sat in an easy chair, reading the translations for pleasure, insight struck.  \u201cThis light bulb came on in my head. It didn't flash right away but it was kind of a low and then medium and then high,\u201d Swanson says. \u201cI realised that I was potentially reading about events that I had been studying in the field, geologically, during the preceding months.\u201d  The chants told the story of Pele, Deity of the volcano Kilauea, who\u2019d initially moved to Kauai with her relatives and fell in love with a man called Lohi\u2019au. Kauai wasn\u2019t hot enough for Pele, however, so she settled in the crater at Kilauea on the big island of Hawaii. She then asked her sister Hi\u2019iaka to fetch Lohi\u2019au, giving her a time limit of 40 days.  > It was a very earthy love triangle  Hi'iaka agreed on the condition that her sister kept her fires away from Hi'iaka\u2019s beloved grove of flowering trees. But when Hi'iaka arrived at Kauai, she found Lohi\u2019au dead and, by the time she revived him, the 40 days were up.  Pele, thinking that Hi'iaka had stolen Lohi\u2019au for herself, set the forest on fire. Hi\u2019iaka then sought her revenge by returning to Kilauea and making love to Lohi\u2019au in view of Pele. Pele\u2019s response was fast and furious: She killed Lohi\u2019au and threw his body into her crater. Hi'iaka then dug furiously to recover the body sending rocks flying into the air. \u201cIt was a very earthy love triangle,\u201d Swanson says.  When Swanson read the story, his insights told him it related the two largest volcanic events that had happened on the island since people had lived there.  > We were clearly wrong and we only realised this very recently  The burning forest most likely was a lava flow in the 15th century, one that lasted for 60 years and covered almost 430 square kilometres of the island of Hawaii. Hi'iaka\u2019s furious digging may have represented the dropping down of the Kilauea summit to form a caldera.  Until recently geologists had believed the caldera formed in 1790 during a period of large explosions, and the volcano was quiet in the proceeding centuries. But oral history says the caldera had existed for \u201cmany kings\u2019 reigns\u201d before and that red-hot stones often flew into the air during this time. Only in the early 21st century did geologists find evidence to confirm the myth\u2019s timeline.  \u201cWe were clearly wrong and we only realised this very recently,\u201d Swanson says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty embarrassing that geologists failed to take the Pele\u2013Hi\u2018iaka chants into account because we hadn\u2019t believed that the chants had any real meaning.\u201d  Swanson believes that many more scientific treasures lie in the Hawaiian chants, ready for scientists to decipher.  **Crowdsourcing through the millennia**  Perhaps one of the oldest myths of mankind is that of Atlantis - the story about a prosperous kingdom that disappeared without trace. As the story goes, the people in this utopian civilization enraged the gods so much with their moral corruption that the deities sent one terrible night of fire and earthquakes. These catastrophes sank Atlantis into the ocean, never to be found.  The ancient Greek philosopher Plato told this moral tale in his dialogues, Critias and Timaeus, and for centuries scholars have debated whether those events were true, or invented, and what the location of Atlantis might have been.  One incident that bears a striking similarity to the story was the massive volcanic eruption of the island of Santorini in the Aegean Sea near Greece about 3,600 years ago. The highly advanced civilization of Minoans who lived on the island disappeared about the same time. The eruption itself inspired the Greek poet Hesiod to write the poem Theogony in around 700 B.C., which described the battle of giants and gods on Mount Olympus.  > Here was a myth that supported what archeologists found  \u201cI started to become interested in the myth of Atlantis and the poem Theogony because these are our only written or only documented descriptions or interpretations of this huge volcanic phenomenon,\u201d Sigurdsson says. \u201cWe don't have any other accounts so, if you accept that they are related to this event, then they do give you some information that you otherwise wouldn't have.\u201d  Several studies support the theory that the volcanic disaster of Plato's story of Atlantis relates to the Santorini eruption. \u201cAnd once archeologists began to dig on Santorini they looked to the legend as a form of validation of what they were finding,\u201d says John Dvorak, a geoscientist at the University of Hawaii, US.  \u201cOne of the things you always look for in science is supportive evidence and consistency,\u201d Dvorak says. \u201cAnd here was a myth that supported what archeologists found. The timing was right and it looks to be consistent.\u201d  Myths such as these have helped scientists understand some very large past events, Sigurdsson says. One such large event was the eruption of Kuwae in 1453, a volcano in the islands of Vanuatu in the Southwest Pacific. This proved to be one of the largest eruptions anywhere on Earth within the last 10,000 years and was so big it simply sank the island into the sea.  > We can't afford to dismiss any source of information about past events  Piecing together the details of an eruption from the geological record can be tricky, Nunn says. Geologists analyse the lava, sediments and other debris that came from the volcano to determine what happened - material that\u2019s become changed, reworked and redeposited over time.  \u201cYou're trying to piece together the whole event from those isolated bits of information and it involves a huge amount of assumptions,\u201d Nunn says. \u201cBut a lot of the old histories and myths that talk about volcanic eruptions do actually give us insight into the sequencing.\u201d  The Kuwae myths also talk about events leading up to the eruption. In this way, they provide valuable information on how to recognise the precursors of such eruptions, Nunn says. The oral traditions talk about sorcerers digging holes and hot water soaring out, unusual noises from the crater and the exodus of tigers, monkeys and rabbits into the villages before the final eruption.  On the island of Savo in the Solomon Islands, which witnesses a major eruption every 110 years or so, oral traditions relate the filling of the crater with water, local earthquakes and tsunamis and the die-back of vegetation as the lead up to an explosion. From these tales the modern island inhabitants know the warning signs of an eruption and can respond optimally, Nunn says.  \u201cI think that we can't afford to dismiss any source of information about past events,\u201d Nunn says. \u201cBut it's taken science a long time to wake up to the value of these kinds of traditions.\u201d  **Creating meaning from mayhem**  Early attempts to explain volcanic activity sound much like myths to modern day scientists. The ancient Greeks believed volcanoes came from the release of compressed air inside mountains, much like a monstrous belch. The Romans took a more engineering approach in their explanations: they blamed eruptions on chemical reactions and underground compounds catching fire.  \u201cThey were trying to attribute what they saw to natural processes rather than to extraterrestrial or godly activity,\u201d Sigurdsson says. \u201cThey were moving away from myths and moving toward realism.\u201d  Over the centuries the ideas became more sophisticated, although the theories did take a backward turn with the rise of Christian conceptions of Hell.  The physicist Sir Isaac Newton, most famous for his cosmological and gravitational studies, also practiced alchemy in a shed behind his laboratory. He showed that combining iron and sulphur lead to the release of a lot of heat. This reaction, Newton said, was the origin of volcanic activity.  > Myths and rituals help people cope with disaster  \u201cThat was the same theory the Romans had put forth about a thousand years before,\u201d Sigurdsson says.   Finally, 19th and 20th-century research in thermodynamics, petrology, geochemistry and plate tectonics moved volcanology from \"divine science\" and \"armchair geology\" to the current understanding of volcanic activity. \u201cI think we have a pretty comprehensive working hypothesis now and it's stood the test of time,\u201d Sigurdsson says.  But volcanologists still can\u2019t tell when a volcano is going to erupt, and for how long, and what is going to happen when it does, Dvorak says. What volcanologists can give you are some probabilities.  \u201cIt might erupt. This may or may not happen. This is more likely than that,\u201d he says.  Dvorak was present at eruptions in Indonesia and Mount St. Helens and heard some members of the public say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201d  And myths, and the belief in divine retribution, still prevail. After the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in the US, two local Christian priests announced that the volcano had erupted because people had not been charitable enough and were not taking proper care of their families. \u201cEven in the most highly technical society, people are still trying to grasp meaning in that way,\u201d Dvorak says.  So while science can\u2019t provide all the answers, maybe people still need myths to make sense of the senseless and to claw some meaning from the mayhem. Maybe myths provide a valuable tool for coming to terms with destruction and disaster, or living under a constant umbrella of uncertainty.  So even in this age of advanced science and technology, myths still have their place.  Myths can provide meaning and the rituals they inspire can provide comfort and a sense of security, Dvorak says. \u201cMyths and rituals help people cope with disaster, albeit in a very different way.\u201d", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Why ancient myths about volcanoes are often true", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150318-why-volcano-myths-are-true", "countriesMentioned": ["Australia", "Vanuatu", "Indonesia", "Greece", "United States", "South Africa", "Japan", "New Zealand"], "author": "Jane Palmer"},{"newsText": "**Reputation:** _Sloths are lazy and stupid. They have to be because they look it. They are covered in algae. Yuck! They climb to the ground to perform a ritual defecation at the base of a tree, a risky business when there are eagle-eyed, fleet-footed predators around. They are bad at crossing roads. Silly sloths._  **Reality:** _Slowness is the ultimate weapon in an evolutionary war against eagle-eyed, fleet-footed predators. What better way to blend in with the forest than to cosy up with algae and fungi. Ritual defecation is the sloth equivalent of speed dating, just without the speed._  Sloths get bad press. In just about every language on the planet, the common name for these creatures has roughly the same meaning. The English have the \u201csloth\u201d (one of the seven deadly sins). The French go for the \u201cla paresse\u201d (\u201cthe lazy one\u201d). In German, it\u2019s \u201cdas Faultier\u201d (\u201clazy animal\u201d). Spanish gives us \u201cel perezoso\u201d (\u201cthe lazy bear\u201d). And so on.  There is, of course, some truth to this common view. But stereotypes tend of obscure a greater underlying truth.  > I suspect that sloths are not slothful at all, they are just bloody careful  Sloths are certainly slow (at absolute top whack they can travel at around 6 cm per second), but lazy they are not. Several years ago, I interviewed Rory Wilson, a biologist at Swansea University, in Wales, UK and the inventor of \u201cthe daily diary\u201d, a nifty electronic gadget that records the movement of animals in incredible detail. At that time, the gizmo had mainly been used to study fast-moving creatures such as penguins and cormorants.  But Wilson was keen to use the device on slow creatures too and sloths were an obvious choice. The fact that they are slow doesn\u2019t make them lazy, he tells me. \u201cNobody calls a bivalve lazy,\u201d he says, talking about slow-moving shellfish such as mussels or clams. He has a point.  In a world populated by predators like big cats and raptors, you\u2019d think that swift would be good. The monkeys that inhabit the same forest canopy as the sloths of Central and South America have gone for this option. But sloths just laugh in the face of such danger, slowly closing their eyes as the simians scatter through the treetops. Instead of running for cover, sloths have opted for an even more impressive strategy: invisibility.  For a sloth, one of the most feared predators is the harpy eagle. \u201cThey are great big eagles with the most appallingly powerful talons and a wicked beak,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cA sloth just doesn\u2019t have the slightest chance.\u201d Unless, that is, it can move so slowly that the eagle can\u2019t see it. \u201cI suspect that sloths are not slothful at all, they are just bloody careful.\u201d  Pulling off this trick requires incredible strength. Imagine a male gymnast performing on the rings, muscles quivering as he holds himself in a crucifix position then raises his legs to the horizontal position. For a sloth, such acrobatics is small potatoes. \u201cIt\u2019ll just move into the sitting crucifix position completely serenely as if there\u2019s no muscular effort involved at all, as if gravity is just turned off.\u201d  **Making fur-dwelling friends**  Under Wilson\u2019s supervision, doctoral student Becky Cliffe has been using the daily diary on the captive inmates at the world\u2019s only sloth sanctuary in Costa Rica. When I called at the appointed time, she was unable to make it to the phone due to a sloth going into unexpected labour. It\u2019s nice that a pregnant sloth has the capacity to surprise, I think.  When I eventually get through to Cliffe, I ask about the microbes that thrive in the sloth\u2019s lush coat. Each one of the sloth\u2019s hairs is basically folded in half. \u201cThe only benefit we can think of to the hair having that structure is so that algae can grow,\u201d she says.  So the sloths want fur-dwelling friends, but why?  A recent study of the sloth\u2019s fur revealed it is home to a range of fungi that are bioactive against strains of the parasites that cause malaria and Chagas disease, and against some human breast cancer cells. For the authors, the sloth\u2019s fur was a novel environment for discovering interesting fungi with medical uses.  > You can\u2019t imagine a sloth trying to lick the back of its head  But they also considered the possibility that these microbes confer some health benefit to sloths. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d says Cliffe. \u201cSloths are so bizarre, it\u2019s perfectly realistic.\u201d  Another paper suggested that sloths are in the farming business. As well as hosting fungi, they cultivate algal gardens in their fur, and these \u201chighly digestible and lipid-rich\u201d algae beef up their limited diet.  Cliffe gives this idea short shrift. \u201cSloths don\u2019t groom with their mouths. They don\u2019t lick their hair. They groom with their hands,\u201d she says. What\u2019s more, the algae tend to be concentrated around the head and the neck where the hairs are longest. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine a sloth trying to lick the back of its head.\u201d  For Cliffe, the most likely explanation for the sloth\u2019s interest in algae and other microbes is to use them to camouflage their fur, and hide from those nasty eagles. \u201cSloths in the wild are completely green and blend in to the canopy.\u201d  Sloths have another talent that is not widely known: holding on (and we\u2019re not talking about their ability to cling to trees).  \u201cTheir stomachs can weigh up to one-third of their body weight,\u201d says Cliffe, more than twice that expected for an animal its size. This turns out to be part of an unusually continent digestive strategy. In comparison to other mammals, a sloth eats relatively little but what it does munch is subjected to an incredibly tortuous journey through the sloth\u2019s intestine; one study from the 1970s recording the passage of food from the mouth to anus of one sloth at more than 50 days (cited here).  By the time the food reappears, the sloth has managed to extract every last nutrient. What\u2019s left, says Cliffe, is \u201cjust a tough ball of very fibrous faeces.\u201d  **Ritual defecation**  The sloth has an interesting toilet ritual that is the cause of much sniggering. Rather than going up in the canopy as one might assume, sloths climb down to the ground to perform a ritual dump at the base of a tree. This is an incredibly risky manoeuvre, one that is likely to lay these animals open to predation by big cats such as the jaguar. Mercifully, their impressive powers of retention mean that they don\u2019t need to do this often, typically just once a week.  But why go to the trouble of going to ground at all? Why not release these fibrous nuggets like bombs?  An interesting truth strongly suggests that it must have something to do with sex. \u201cWhen a female is in estrus, she will come down to the ground and go to the bathroom every single day and that happens between eight and ten days every single month,\u201d says Cliffe. Given the amount of energy this requires and the increased risk of being spotted by a predator, she has to have a good reason to do this.  As is so often the case in the animal kingdom, sex is the obvious incentive. Leaving a humungous pile of fibrous dung, it seems, is the sloth equivalent of placing a personal ad. A female descends to inform any males in the area about her reproductive status and at the same time picks up on everything she needs to know about those who have been there before her. It\u2019s like speed dating without the speed.  Sure, a gurning sloth looks like an idiot. But the truth about sloths is that humans have done a very bad job at figuring out why they do what they do. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many mammals left on the planet that are so unusual yet we still know so little about,\u201d says Cliffe.  **Tweetable sloth facts:**  A sloth at full tilt travels at 6 centimetres per second  A sloth\u2019s stomach can weigh over one-third of its body weight  A sloth will typically only defecate once every 7 to 10 days  A sloth may take 50 days or more to digest its food", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The truth about sloths", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20140916-the-truth-about-sloths", "countriesMentioned": ["United States", "United Kingdom"], "author": "Henry Nicholls"},{"newsText": "**1\\. Indian rhinoceros (_Rhinoceros unicornis_)**  Also known as the greater one-horned rhinoceros,this is the largest of the three Asian rhino species, reaching 4m (13ft) long. As the name suggests, it also has the most impressive horn, rivalled only by the white rhino of Africa.  The Indian rhinoceros grows just one of these spectacular appendages. It is made of keratin, the same fibrous protein that makes fingernails and hair. Its horn can grow up to 1m (3ft 3in) long. This has made it a prime target for poachers throughout history.  According to the International Rhino Foundation, there is a common misconception that the powdered horn is used in Chinese medicine to treat erectile dysfunction. It is actually the outdated practice of using it to treat fevers and convulsions that makes it highly sought after on the black market. Intense hunting pressure pushed the species to the brink of extinction in the 20th century, with fewer than 200 left in the wild.  Now, thanks to strict protection, numbers have recovered to more than 3000 at the last count. But with 70% of the population in a single national park, this armoured unicorn is not out of the woods.  **2\\. Saola (_Pseudoryx nghetinhensis_)**  If you believe unicorns should be enigmatic, the saola fits the bill. It was only discovered in 1992, near Vietnam's border with Laos, when scientists found unique skulls in the homes of local hunters.  Analysis of the bones revealed the saola is related to cattle. Its name in Vietnamese means \"spindle horn\" in reference to the pair of parallel, straight horns, which can be 50cm (20in) long. Its nickname the \"Asian unicorn\" actually refers to its rarity.  The species has never been seen in person by a scientist. As of May 2015, it has only been recorded in the wild four times, using camera traps.  As a result their population can only be estimated, using remotely-captured photos, genetic analysis of dung and interviews with those living in the remote Annamite mountains. Experts estimate there could be fewer than 100 left in existence, their numbers under threat from hunters and fragmentation of the forest by roads.  They are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and conservationists are now striving to save them by appointing forest guards to crack down on illegal hunting.  **3\\. Narwhal (_Monodon monoceros_)**  In tales of the unicorn, much is made of the horn's magical properties. In nature, the narwhal's is arguably the most magical, as it has remarkable sensory powers.  The narwhal's tusk can grow to 2.6m (9ft) long, half as long as its body. It is actually not a horn, but an overgrown canine tooth that spirals counter- clockwise out of the left side of the animal's mouth.  No one is sure what it is for. It could be used as an ice pick, helping narwhals travel through the icy Arctic waters, or an acoustic probe or even a lance to battle for mates. Tusks are more common among males, so many think it is a sexual characteristic, with the largest tusk indicating the healthiest male.  In 2014, scientists analysed this tooth in detail and discovered it has no enamel. Instead, water flows through the tooth to nerve endings so the narwhal can sense differences in how warm and salty the sea is.  **4\\. Unicornfish (_Naso_ sp.)**  Unicorns can also be found in warm waters, in the shape of the colourful tropical tangs known commonly as unicornfish. Half of the fish in the genus_ Naso_, from the Latin \"nasus\"for \"nose\", have unicorn-like knobs on their heads.  This varies from a fleshy bump in the bignose unicornfish to an extended bony horn in the whitemargin unicornfish. The horn develops with age, forcing the fish to change their diets. Young unicornfish feed on algae on the seabed, but adults of certain species switch to snacking on free-floating zooplankton or fish poo once their horn starts getting in the way.  One of the largest species is the bluespine unicornfish, which can reach 60cm (2 ft) in length with a 6cm (2.5in) horn. It is a pale olive colour with two bright blue plates bearing curved, knife-like spines where its tail meets its body. These scalpel-sharp spines are for defense.  However scientists have so far failed to explain unicornfish's oversized noses.  **5\\. Texas unicorn mantis (_Phyllovates chlorophaea_)**  Several species share the name \"unicorn mantis\". It refers to a horn-like projection between their antennae. The horn is actually composed of two parts that grow side by side but do not fuse.  Among the best known is the Texas unicorn mantis, which lives near the US border with Mexico and grows to 7.5cm (3in) long.  It belongs to the Mantidae family, which are called praying mantises because they fold their forelimbs as if in prayer. \"Preying mantis\" might be more appropriate, though, as they are renowned for their big appetites.  The Texas unicorn mantis is an ambush hunter. Its body is a mottled grey-brown for camouflage, and its wings mimic bright green leaves to help it blend into the vegetation. It waits, completely motionless, using its impressive compound eyes to look for a meal.  When an unwary moth or grasshopper passes by, the mantis grasps it in a deathly embrace using its forelegs, which close together like the blade of a Swiss army knife. The mantis then slices its prey into bite-size pieces with its mandibles. Not exactly a fairy-tale ending.  6\\. **Okapi (_Okapia johnstoni_)**  In heraldry, unicorns have a patchwork of features from other animals: the body of a white horse, a goat's cloven feet and beard, a lion's tail and a slender horn. In nature, one animal rivals this.  It is horse-sized with a chocolate brown body, zebra-striped legs, large cow- like ears, a 15cm (6in) pair of horns on the males, and a relatively long neck. No wonder early explorers of the Congo region called the okapi the \"African unicorn\".  The neck is the clue to the okapi's true heritage: it is the closest relative of the giraffe. While giraffes live on the plains where leafy meals are served at height, okapis live in the rainforest where food is easier to come by. As a result, they are shorter than their lofty cousins and stand on average 1.7m (5ft 6in) tall at the shoulder.  Their camouflage stripes help them to blend in to the dappled shade of the forest. They are so well hidden, they remained undiscovered until the turn of the 20th century, long after most of Africa's other big mammals.  Despite being a protected species since 1933, the okapi is still hunted for bushmeat and threatened by habitat loss, so its future is uncertain.  **7\\. Goblin spiders (_Unicorn_ sp.)**  Spiders of the genus _Unicorn_ are named for a pointy protrusion between the eyes and jaws of the males, known as the clypeal horn. You'll need a microscope to see it, though. These spiders are extremely small, reaching a maximum body length of just 3mm (0.1in).  They live in high, dry conditions 1000-4000m (3280-13,123ft) above sea level in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Perhaps because they are so tiny, _Unicorn_ spiders have only been known to science since the 1990s and little is known about them.  Female _U. catleyi _have been found with the broken tips of male genitalia lodged in their reproductive tracts. This suggests males of the species sacrifice their own genitalia as a kind of plug, to block others from mating with the female.  _Unicorn_ spiders suffer from a mythical personality disorder, as they belong to a family called Oonopidae, commonly known as goblin spiders. Over 1,500 different species of these tiny goblins have been described from around the world, some of which are said to shimmer like glitter.  **8\\. Helmeted curassows (_Pauxi_ sp.)**  Purists will argue that any unicorn worthy of the name should be able to fly, but they might not expect a unicorn bird. Helmeted curassows areturkey-sized black birds that live in the dense forests of South America. Each bird has a pale blue ornamental horn or \"casque\" on its forehead, which can grow to 6 cm (2.5 in).  The northern helmeted curassow (shown above) lives in Colombia. Its southern counterpart, which is technically known as _P. unicornis_, was thought to live in two separate populations: one in central Bolivia and the other 1000km (621 miles) away in the Sira mountains of Peru.  However, in 2011 scientists found that the Peruvian birds had shorter horns and shorter songs, and bred at a different time of year. They are now thought to be a separate species, _P. koepckeae_.  The newly recognised species is now considered critically endangered, as is the original unicorn bird.  \"[The unicorn bird] is one of the most threatened species in the world, because of hunting and clearance of its forest home at the foot of the Andes,\" says Ross MacLeod of the University of Glasgow in the UK. \"But it is a species we can still save from extinction with a concerted conservation effort.\"  **9\\. Unicorn shrimp (_Plesionika narval_)**  The unicorn shrimp is named for the elongated horn-like \"rostrum\" that extends in front of its eyes. The rostrumis covered in closely-set teeth and projects like a serrated red spear between its two white antennae.  Its scientific name is actually a nod to the other unicorn of the sea, the narwhal. While unicorn whales live only in the Arctic, the unicorn shrimp is rather more cosmopolitan. It is found off Angola, up to the Mediterranean Sea and all the way across to French Polynesia.  The unicorn shrimp only lives in cold water, and can be found down to a depth of 910 m (2985 ft), where it feeds on the sea bed. It uses its long antennae, which can be triple its body length, to pick up chemical clues.  It is considered a delicacy around the south-east Aegean Sea, particularly in Rhodes. However, following a drastic stock reduction, a project has been launched to find out more about the shrimp and manage it sustainably.  **10\\. Arabian oryx (_Oryx leucoryx_)**  The Arabian oryx meets so many of the criteria for a unicorn, it has been described as the \"prototype\" of the creature. Ancient authorities Aristotle and Pliny the Elder both described it as a one-horned animal but they must have been describing it side-on: the Arabian oryx has two horns that can reach 75cm (29in) long.  The oryx is white with a dark tufted tail and, as an antelope, it has cloven hooves. It can also detect rainfall and move towards it, which to travellers in the deserts of the Middle East may have seemed magical.  Like so many of the unicorn's namesakes, the oryx has been subjected to terrible hunting pressures, and in the 1970s was declared extinct in the wild. But it has since been brought back.  Following a successful captive breeding programme, Arabian oryx have been reintroduced to several countries including Oman, Israel and Jordan. There are now an estimated 1000 animals living wild again, so for now at least the Arabian oryx is more than just a myth.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Meet ten animals that look like real-life unicorns", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150521-meet-the-ten-real-life-unicorns", "countriesMentioned": ["Bolivia, Plurinational State of", "Central African Republic", "Israel", "Angola", "Colombia", "Mexico", "Viet Nam", "Peru", "Jordan", "Chile", "Oman", "Argentina", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Australia", "Canada", "Greece", "South Africa", "Panama"], "author": "Ella Davies"},{"newsText": "If you go into outer space without protection, you'll die.  The lack of pressure would force the air in your lungs to rush out. Gases dissolved in your body fluids would expand, pushing the skin apart and forcing it to inflate like a balloon. Your eardrums and capillaries would rupture, and your blood would start to bubble and boil. Even if you survived all that, ionising radiation would rip apart the DNA in your cells. Mercifully, you would be unconscious in 15 seconds.  > How do these seemingly insignificant creatures survive in such extreme conditions?  But one group of animals can survive this: tiny creatures called tardigrades about 1mm long. In 2007, thousands of tardigrades were attached to a satellite and blasted into space. After the satellite had returned to Earth, scientists examined them and found that many of them had survived. Some of the females had even laid eggs in space, and the newly-hatched young were healthy.  It's not just the harsh environs of outer space that tardigrades can survive in. The little critters seem adept at living in some of the harshest regions of Earth. They have been discovered 5546m (18,196ft) up a mountain in the Himalayas, in Japanese hot springs, at the bottom of the ocean and in Antarctica. They can withstand huge amounts of radiation, being heated to 150 \u00b0C, and being frozen almost to absolute zero.  How do these seemingly insignificant creatures survive in such extreme conditions, and why have they evolved these superpowers? It turns out that tardigrades have a host of tricks up their sleeves, which would put most organisms to shame.  Tardigrades, at first glance, are intimidating. They have podgy faces with folds of flesh, a bit like a _Doctor Who_ monster. They have eight legs, with ferocious claws resembling those of great bears. Their mouth is also a serious weapon, with dagger-like teeth that can spear prey.  > Fossils of tardigrades have been dated to the Cambrian period over 500 million years ago  But there's no need to worry. Tardigrades are one of nature's smallest animals. They are never more than 1.5 mm long, and can only be seen with a microscope. They are commonly known as \"water bears\".  There are 900 known species. Most feed by sucking the juices from moss, lichens and algae. Others are carnivores, and can even prey on other tardigrades.  They are truly ancient. Fossils of tardigrades have been dated to the Cambrian period over 500 million years ago, when the first complex animals were evolving. And ever since they were discovered, it has been clear that they are special.  Tardigrades were discovered in 1773 by a German pastor named Johann August Ephraim Goeze. Three years later, the Italian clergyman and scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani discovered that they had superpowers.  Spallanzani added water to sediment from a rain gutter, and looked under a microscope. He found hundreds of little bear-shaped creatures swimming around. In his book \"Opuscoli di Fisica Animale, e Vegetabile\", he named them \"il Tardigrado\", meaning \"slow-stepper\", because they moved so slowly.  > In 1995, dried tardigrades were brought back to life after 8 years  In truth, this wasn't a first. Back in 1702, the Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek sent a letter to the Royal Society in London, entitled \"On certain animalcules found in the sediment in gutters on the roofs of houses\". He took dry, apparently lifeless dust from a gutter and added water. Using a microscope of his own devising, Leeuwenhoek found that within an hour many small \"animalcules\" became active, and began swimming and crawling around.  These animals were rotifers, tiny aquatic creatures that look like they have wheels on their heads. They could seemingly survive months without water.  However, tardigrades may be able to survive without it for decades. In 1948, the Italian zoologist Tina Franceschi claimed that tardigrades found in dried moss from museum samples over 120 years old could be reanimated. After rehydrating a tardigrade, she observed one of its front legs moving.  This finding has never been replicated. But it does not seem impossible. In 1995, dried tardigrades were brought back to life after 8 years.  For most animals, life without water is completely impossible.  \"When a typical cell dries out its membranes rupture and leak, and its proteins unfold and aggregate together, making them useless,\" says extremophile researcher Thomas Boothby\u00a0 of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. \"DNA will also start to fragment the longer it is dry.\"  > The tardigrade curls up into a dry husk  Somehow tardigrades avoid all this. \"Since water bears can survive drying, they must have tricks for preventing or fixing the damage that cells like ours would die from,\" says Boothby.  How do they do it? One of the key discoveries came in 1922, courtesy of a German scientist named H. Baumann. He found that when a tardigrade dries out it retracts its head and its eight legs. It then enters a deep state of suspended animation that closely resembles death.  Shedding almost all the water in its body, the tardigrade curls up into a dry husk. Baumann called this a \"T\u00f6nnchenform\", but it is now commonly known as a \"tun\"_. _Its metabolism slows to 0.01% of the normal rate. It can stay in this state for decades, only reanimating when it comes into contact with water.    Besides tardigrades, some nematode worms, yeast and bacteria can also survive desiccation. They do this by making a lot of a particular sugar called trehalose. This sugar forms a glass-like state inside their cells that stabilises key components, such as proteins and membranes, which would otherwise be destroyed.  > Tardigrades might have unique tricks for surviving desiccation  Trehalose can also wrap itself around any remaining water molecules, stopping them from rapidly expanding if the temperature rises. Rapidly expanding water molecules are dangerous because they can rupture cells, which can be fatal.  You might expect that tardigrades would use this trick to survive drying, but according to Boothby, only some species seem to make trehalose. \"Some species do not appear to contain trehalose, or make it at such low levels that the sugar is undetectable,\" he says.  \"This suggests that tardigrades might have unique tricks for surviving desiccation,\" says Boothby. \"We know that, as they start to dry out, tardigrades make protectants that allow them to survive becoming completely dry. But what exactly these protectants are is still a mystery.\"  When tardigrades start to dry out, they seem to make a lot of antioxidants. These are chemicals, like vitamins C and E, that soak up dangerously reactive chemicals. This may mop up harmful chemicals in the tardigrades' cells.  > The tun state is key to tardigrades' ability to cope with being dried out  Tardigrades face a particular threat from \"reactive oxygen species\". These substances are produced as by-products of normal cell function, but can break down the main components of a cell, including its DNA. Animals exposed to environmental stress often have lots of them floating around.  The antioxidants may explain one of tardigrades' neatest abilities. If a tardigrade stays in its dry tun state for a long time, its DNA gets damaged. But after it reawakens it is able to quickly fix it.  It's clear that the tun state is key to tardigrades' ability to cope with being dried out. But long before Baumann discovered it, tardigrades had revealed other superpowers.  For starters, they seem not to care what temperature it is. In 1842 a French scientist named Doy\u00e8re showed that a tardigrade in its tun state could survive being heated to temperatures of 125 \u00b0C for several minutes. In the 1920s, a Benedictine friar named Gilbert Franz Rahm brought tardigrades back to life after heating them to 151 \u00b0C for 15 minutes.  Rahm also tested them in the cold. He immersed them in liquid air at -200 \u00b0C for 21 months, in liquid nitrogen at -253 \u00b0C for 26 hours, and in liquid helium at -272 \u00b0C for 8 hours. Afterwards the tardigrades sprang back to life as soon as they came into contact with water.  We now know that some tardigrades can tolerate being frozen to -272.8 \u00b0C, just above absolute zero. To put that into perspective, the lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth was a balmy -89.2 \u00b0C in central Antarctica in 1983. The tardigrades coped with a profound chill that does not occur naturally and must be created in the lab, at which atoms come to a virtual standstill.  The biggest hazard tardigrades face in the cold is ice. If ice crystals form inside their cells, they can tear apart crucial molecules like DNA.  > Tardigrades can actually tolerate ice forming within their cells  Some animals, including some fish, make antifreeze proteins that lower the freezing point of their cells, ensuring that ice doesn't form. But these proteins haven't been found in tardigrades.  Instead it seems tardigrades can actually tolerate ice forming within their cells. Either they can protect themselves from the damage caused by ice crystals, or they can repair it.  Tardigrades may produce chemicals called ice nucleating agents. These encourage ice crystals to form outside their cells rather than inside, protecting the vital molecules. Trehalose sugar may also protect those that produce it, as it prevents the formation of large ice crystals that would perforate the cell membranes.  But while we have some idea of how tardigrades cope with the cold, we have no idea how they cope with heat. At scorching temperatures like 150 \u00b0C, proteins and cell membranes should unravel, and the chemical reactions that sustain life cease to happen.  The most heat-tolerant organisms known are bacteria that live around the edges of hydrothermal vents in the deep sea. They can still grow at 122 \u00b0C. If Rahm is to be believed, tardigrades can survive even higher temperatures.  Many animals that have evolved to live in hot places, like hot springs and scorching deserts, produce chemicals called heat shock proteins. These act as chaperones for proteins inside cells, helping them keep their shape. They also repair heat-damaged proteins.  That's all well and good, but there is no conclusive evidence that tardigrades produce these chemicals. Factor in the other things they can survive, and the picture becomes even more baffling.  In 1964, scientists exposed tardigrades to lethal doses of X-rays and found that they could survive. \u00a0Later experiments showed they can also cope with excessive amounts of alpha, gamma and ultraviolet radiation \u2013 even if they're not in the tun state.  Radiation was one of the biggest threats facing the tardigrades sent into space in 2007. Those exposed to higher levels of radiation fared worse than those protected, but the mortality rate was not 100%.  They can also cope with extreme pressure that would squash most animals flat, according to a study published in 1998 by Kunihiro Seki and Masato Toyoshima of Kanagawa University in Hiratsuka, Japan. They found that tardigrades in the tun state could survive a pressure of 600 megapascals (MPa).  > At these crushing pressures, proteins and DNA are ripped apart  This is beyond anything they might encounter in nature. The deepest part of the sea is the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, which goes down 10,994 m. There, the water pressure is around 100 MPa. Somehow the tardigrades survived six times that.  At these crushing pressures, proteins and DNA are ripped apart. Cell membranes, which are composed of fat, become solid like butter in a fridge. Most microorganisms stop metabolising at 30 MPa, and bacteria can't survive much beyond 300 MPa.  The sheer variety of stressors that tardigrades can survive is almost dizzying. But maybe the explanation is surprisingly simple.  Extreme heat and cold, radiation and high pressures all have one thing in common: they damage DNA and other bits of the tardigrades' cells. Heat and cold both cause proteins to unfold, stick together and stop working. Radiation tears up DNA and other crucial molecules. High pressures solidify the fatty membranes around cells.  So if all the stressors cause similar problems, maybe the tardigrades only need a handful of tricks to survive them. \"Nobody knows for sure,\" says Boothby. But \"there are certainly some good reasons to think that overlapping strategies might be used to cope with some of these extremes.\"  > Freezing a tardigrade and drying it out both cause the same problem  For instance, being dried out and being exposed to radiation both damage the tardigrades' DNA. \"So it would make sense that tardigrades response to these two conditions in a similar way,\" says Boothby: by making antioxidants and repairing the damaged DNA.  If that's true, tardigrades' resistance to radiation is a happy accident: a side-effect of their adaptation to sudden drought. Similarly, freezing a tardigrade and drying it out both cause the same problem: not enough liquid water in the animal's cells.  Oddly enough the tun state, their most famous trick, is also the least versatile. \"Tardigrades can survive freezing, radiation, and low-oxygen conditions without forming a tun,\" says Boothby. \"So the tun state is probably a specific adaptation for dealing with or slowing water loss.\" However it does also allow them to survive extreme pressure.  This idea, that tardigrades are only using one or two survival tricks, might help explain the other big question about them: why do they bother?  > They have evolved to cope with environments so extreme, they don't even exist on Earth  Unlike bacteria that live in boiling hot springs or other extreme sites, most tardigrades live in relatively unremarkable places. They tend to live in or near water, and there's nothing a tardigrade likes more than a good chunk of moss and lichen. Their lives aren't even that exciting: while most creatures their size dart about frantically, tardigrades are sluggish.  Yet despite their rather tedious lifestyle, they have evolved to cope with environments so extreme, they don't even exist on Earth.  Or rather, some of them have. The oldest and most primitive group of tardigrades, the Arthrotardigrada, cannot survive extreme conditions or suspend their metabolism. These more vulnerable creatures offer a clue to why the other tardigrades got so tough.  Arthrotardigrada only live in the ocean. It's only land-dwelling and fresh- water species that have the extreme survival skills. That suggests leaving the ocean was the key.  > Today they can be found in some of the driest places on Earth  \"One reason that marine tardigrades aren't as good at surviving extremes is that they just don't need to be,\" says Boothby. \"Oceans are so big that they don't undergo rapid changes in temperature or salinity, and they certainly don't dry up overnight.\"  By contrast, the land is dangerously changeable. Tardigrades need a thin layer of water around their bodies to breath, eat, mate and move around. But in many parts of the land, drought is a risk. \"The tardigrades that live in these places need to be able to cope when their environments suddenly change,\" says Boothby.  So it makes sense that land-dwelling tardigrades would evolve a way to survive suddenly being dried out. It was a matter of survival. What's more, once they had it, the land tardigrades could exploit new habitats. Today they can be found in some of the driest places on Earth, where other animals cannot survive.  But this idea just raises another question. If being able to survive drying out is so useful for land animals, why don't they all do it? Why didn't frogs, earthworms and humans evolve the same ability?  Similarly, why can't other animals survive the heat, cold and radiation that tardigrades can? Perhaps the question isn't why tardigrades are so tough, but why other animals are so vulnerable.  > Going into the tun state is a risky decision  \"There are probably several reasons why more animals and plants haven't evolved the tardigrades' abilities,\" says Boothby. \"Many animals probably just don't need to. They either don't live in environments that can quickly dry out, or they can develop ways of avoiding drying out, like the camel.\"  But beyond that, there are surely costs to the tardigrades' abilities \u2013 costs that other animals have avoided paying. In particular, going into the tun state is a risky decision.  \"When a tardigrade completely dries out, it becomes inactive and is unable to actively avoid dangers in its surroundings,\" says Boothby. An inactive tardigrade might not die of thirst, but it could get eaten. \"We know that a lot of desiccation-tolerant organisms have to make xenoprotectants: molecules that keep bacteria and fungi from basically eating them while they are in their inactive state.\"  It may be that becoming as tough as a tardigrade wouldn\u2019t pay off for other animals. But it has worked for them. They are 500 million years old and live all over the planet, so they aren't going anywhere.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Tardigrades return from the dead", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150313-the-toughest-animals-on-earth", "countriesMentioned": ["Japan", "Antarctica", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa", "Bulgaria"], "author": "Jasmin Fox-Skelly"},{"newsText": "If you could build a time machine and go back to Earth's distant past, you'd get a nasty surprise. You wouldn't be able to breathe the air. Unless you had some breathing apparatus, you would asphyxiate within minutes.  For the first half of our planet's history, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere. This life-giving gas only started to appear about 2.4 billion years ago.  This \"Great Oxidation Event\" was one of the most important things to ever happen on this planet. Without it, there could never have been any animals that breathe oxygen: no insects, no fish, and certainly no humans.  For decades, scientists have worked to understand how and why the first oxygen was pumped into the air. They have long suspected that life itself was responsible for creating the air that we breathe.  But not just any life. If the latest findings are to be believed, life itself was undergoing a tremendous transformation just before the Great Oxidation Event. This evolutionary leap forward may be the key to understanding what happened.  Earth was already 2 billion years old at the time of the Great Oxidation Event, having formed 4.5 billion years ago. It was inhabited, but only by single-celled organisms.  > They evolved a way to take energy from sunlight  It's not clear exactly when life began, but the oldest known fossils of these microorganisms date back 3.5 billion years, so it must have been before that. That means life had been around for at least a billion years before the Great Oxidation Event.  Those simple life-forms are the prime suspects for the Great Oxidation Event. One group in particular stands out: cyanobacteria. Today, these microscopic organisms sometimes form bright blue-green layers on ponds and oceans.  Their ancestors invented a trick that has since spread like wildlife. They evolved a way to take energy from sunlight, and use it to make sugars out of water and carbon dioxide.  This is called photosynthesis, and today it's how all green plants get their food. That tree down your street is pretty much using the same chemical process that the first cyanobacteria used billions of years ago.  > It was the cyanobacteria, pumping out unwanted oxygen, that transformed Earth's atmosphere  From the bacteria's point of view, photosynthesis has one irritating downside. It produces oxygen as a waste product. Oxygen is of no use to them, so they release it into the air.  So there's a simple explanation for the Great Oxidation Event. It was the cyanobacteria, pumping out unwanted oxygen, that transformed Earth's atmosphere.  But while this explains how it happened, it doesn't explain why, and it certainly doesn't explain when it happened.  The problem is that cyanobacteria seem to have been around long before the Great Oxidation Event. \"They're probably among the first organisms we have on this planet,\" says Bettina Schirrmeister of the University of Bristol in the UK.  > Maybe the cyanobacteria changed  We can be confident that there were cyanobacteria by 2.9 billion years ago, because there is evidence of isolated \"oxygen oases\" at that time. They might date as far back as 3.5 billion years, but it's hard to tell because the fossil record is so patchy.  That means the cyanobacteria were busy pumping out oxygen for at least half a billion years before oxygen started appearing in the air. That doesn't make a lot of sense.  One explanation is that there were a lot of chemicals around \u2013 perhaps volcanic gases \u2013 that reacted with the oxygen, effectively \"mopping it up\".  But there's another possibility, says Schirrmeister. Maybe the cyanobacteria changed. \"Some evolutionary innovation in cyanobacteria helped them to become more successful and more important,\" she says.  Some modern cyanobacteria have done something that, by bacterial standards, is remarkable. While the vast majority of bacteria are single cells, they are multicellular.  > Multicellularity could have been a game-changer for Earth's early cyanobacteria  The individual cyanobacterial cells have joined up into stringy filaments, like the carriages of a train. That in itself is unusual for bacteria, but some have gone further.  \"Many cyanobacteria are able to produce specialised cells that lose their ability to divide,\" says Schirrmeister. \"This is the first form of specialisation we see.\" It's a simple version of the many specialised cells that animals have, such as muscle, nerve and blood cells.  Schirrmeister thinks multicellularity could have been a game-changer for Earth's early cyanobacteria. It offers several possible advantages.  On the early Earth, single-celled organisms often lived together in flat layers of gunk called \"mats\". Within each mat there would have been many different species of cyanobacteria, and a host of other things to boot.  > The Earth was being bombarded with harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun  A multicellular cyanobacterium would have one clear advantage compared to its single-celled rivals. It would find it easier to spread, because its larger surface area would mean it was better at attaching itself to slippery rocks. Such an organism would be \"less likely to wash away in the current\", says Schirrmeister.  Many modern multicellular cyanobacteria can move around within their mats. \"They're not extremely fast but they can move,\" says Schirrmeister. That suggests the primordial ones could as well.  Moving could have helped them survive. At the time the Earth was being bombarded with harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, and there was no ozone layer to keep it out.  \"In modern mats, cyanobacteria will turn around and appear vertical instead of horizontal to protect themselves from excess sunlight,\" says Schirrmeister. \"You have also movement between layers. It might be these multicellular cyanobacteria had the ability to position themselves optimally within the mat.\"  It's a neat idea. But for it to be true, cyanobacteria must have evolved multicellularity before the Great Oxidation Event.  Schirrmeister has spent the last few years trying to figure out when cyanobacteria first evolved multicellularity.  The clues lie in their genes. By examining genes that all cyanobacteria share, and identifying tiny differences between them, Schirrmeister could figure out how they are all related \u2013 essentially drawing up a family tree of cyanobacteria.  With that tree in place, Schirrmeister could then home in on the multicellular cyanobacteria, and estimate roughly when they first became multicellular.  Her first attempt, published in 2011, suggested that most modern cyanobacteria are descended from multicellular ancestors. That suggested multicellularity was ancient, but it was difficult to put a firm date on it.  > Her family tree was only based on one gene  Schirrmeister refined her methods for a second paper, published in 2013. This suggested that multicellularity evolved not long before the Great Oxidation Event, at a time when cyanobacteria were diversifying rapidly.  But that didn't clinch the argument. Her family tree was only based on one gene, albeit a gene shared by every single species of cyanobacterium. That meant the tree was suspect.  So Schirrmeister has now gone one better.  \"This time I worked with 756 genes,\" says Schirrmeister. \"The genes I took are present in all cyanobacteria.\"  > We have multicellularity evolving before the Great Oxidation Event  Her estimate of the origin of multicellularity is still rough, but it seems to be around 2.5 billion years ago \u2013 before the Great Oxidation Event.  There are several different ways to calculate these family trees, and they all gave the same answer. \"No matter how we calibrate our phylogeny, it seems more likely we have multicellularity evolving before the Great Oxidation Event,\" says Schirrmeister.  The results are published in _Palaeontology_.  This may not be the end of the story. Even if Schirrmeister's results are confirmed, and cyanobacteria did become multicellular just before the Great Oxidation Event, there are two big questions.  > It is one of the most important things to ever happen on this planet  The first is, did multicellularity really offer them the advantages she thinks it did? We don't know, but we could find out: by testing how modern single- celled and multicellular cyanobacteria cope with different situations.  The second question is harder: why did it take so long for cyanobacteria to become multicellular? If it is so advantageous, why did they not evolve it sooner, and trigger an earlier Great Oxidation Event?  \"The next step is to find out which genes are responsible for multicellularity in cyanobacteria,\" says Schirrmeister. \"Then I could say why did it take that long, why didn't it evolve earlier.\" If lots of new genes were required, it becomes understandable that it took the cyanobacteria a long time to evolve it.  Whatever caused the Great Oxidation Event, it's clear that it is one of the most important things to ever happen on this planet.  In the short term, it was probably rather bad news for life.  \"Oxygen would have been lethal for many bacteria,\" says Schirrmeister. \"It's hard to prove, because from the fossil record we don't have a lot of deposits from that time\u2026 [but] we can assume we had a lot of bacteria dying at that point.\"  > Those first multicellular cyanobacteria triggered the evolution of complex life  But in the longer term, it allowed a whole new kind of life to evolve. Oxygen is a reactive gas \u2013 that's why it starts fires \u2013 so when some organisms figured out how to harness it, they suddenly had access to a major new source of energy.  By breathing oxygen, organisms could become much more active, and much larger. Moving beyond the simple multicellularity developed by cyanobacteria, some organisms became far more intricate. They became plants and animals, from sponges and worms to fish and, ultimately, humans.  If Schirrmeister is right, those first multicellular cyanobacteria triggered the evolution of complex life, including us, by producing oxygen on a global scale. \"It made complex life possible,\" she says.  Not bad for a bunch of tiny blue-green bacteria.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The event that transformed Earth", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150701-the-origin-of-the-air-we-breathe", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States"], "author": "Michael Marshall"},{"newsText": "The UK only has one native species of cat: the Scottish wildcat. It is about the same size as a domestic cat and lives in tiny, dwindling numbers, exclusively in the Scottish Highlands. But every year thousands of people across the British Isles report seeing much larger felines on the prowl.  For several decades there have been sightings of phantom cats: cat-like creatures that are reportedly far larger than any domestic or wild cat. Most say the creatures are black and about the size of a domestic dog, sometimes larger.  > The animals could be leopards in their black, non-spotted form  The sightings are something of an enigma. Only a small percentage are ever reported to the government. This means that the true figure for how many people see a phantom cat is hard to get at.  The most reliable source of information is the British Big Cats Society, an organisation of amateur enthusiasts. It regularly receives reports from people claiming to have glimpsed a suspiciously large cat. Going by their figures, a few thousand such sightings are made each year.  Many people dismiss phantom cat sightings as misidentifications of dogs or as over-imagined domestic cats. But others maintain that exotic felines really could be stalking our shores.  Various explanations have therefore been suggested. The animals could be leopards in their black, non-spotted form (colloquially called \"panthers\"). They could also be cougars, sometimes known as pumas or mountain lions, as some sightings describe a light or \"sandy\" coloured creature. But is there any truth to any of this?    Phantom cat sightings in the British Isles date back to at least\u00a01825. In that year William Cobbett, a famous farmer and journalist, reported seeing a large grey cat, which he compared in size to a medium-sized spaniel, in the grounds of an abbey in southern England.  But it was not until the mid-20th Century that phantom cats really began to capture the public's imagination.  > A woman was walking her dog in rural Surrey and reported seeing a \"puma- like\" creature  It started with a sequence of strange sightings, once again in southern England.  The first came in 1955. A woman was walking her dog in rural Surrey and reported seeing a \"puma-like\" creature, which quickly slunk away, next to the mutilated carcass of a calf.  Two more sightings\u00a0followed in 1959, both of them in the neighbouring county of Hampshire. One man reported seeing \"an enormous great cat\" crossing a country lane, while a cab driver supposedly saw a \"lion\" jumping over a hedge into a rural\u00a0racecourse.  In the 1960s, there followed many other reports of large, cat-like creatures in and around Surrey. Despite numerous police investigations, none of these sightings was ever substantiated. Nevertheless the \"Surrey puma\" soon became an established urban legend.    Phantom cats were soon spotted in other parts of the country too. In the 1970s and 80s, numerous sightings of a large, black cat-like creature were reported in Exmoor, an expanse of moorland and woods in south-west England. We now know this creature as another legendary phantom cat, the \"beast of Exmoor\".  > Southern England remains a hotspot for phantom cat sightings to this day  The Exmoor sightings caused so much concern that the military were called in. In the summer of 1983, following a number of unexplained sheep killings in the area, a team of Royal Marines was deployed in an attempt to track down this mysterious beast. The soldiers spent several weeks hunting for traces of the creature, but ultimately failed to find any evidence that it existed.  Similarly, a spate of phantom cat sightings in the 1990s, this time on nearby Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, caused the government to call in a pair of investigators to search for the creature \u2013 which by then had been dubbed the \"beast of Bodmin\". The officials spent several months in the field, examining livestock carcasses and footprints for evidence. But like the marines, the pair returned empty handed.  Southern England remains a hotspot for phantom cat sightings to this day. But in recent decades, sightings have also been reported across central and northern England, as well as in various parts of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Could there be any truth to the sightings?  Most experts believe that it is extremely unlikely that any breeding population of non-native felines exists in the UK. That is also the official position of the British government.  But that does not necessarily mean that all of the sightings are false. The phantom cats spotted in the UK could be animals that have been released \u2013 or even escaped \u2013 from captivity.  > Animals which escaped or were set free from illegal collections could be behind some of the phantom cat sightings reported  The latter is certainly plausible. Since 1975, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has received 27 reports of exotic cats that escaped from zoos or private collections. All but three (a jungle cat, an Asiatic golden cat and a lynx) were quickly recaptured or killed following their escape.  That is not to say that all these escaped cats were officially reported. It is against the law to keep non-domestic cats without a license, a law that has existed since 1976. So animals that escaped or were set free from illegal collections could be behind some of the phantom cat sightings reported each year.  For example, a handful of such exotic cats are known to have been captured or killed while roaming wild in the UK: a puma was captured in Scotland in 1980; a jungle cat was killed by a car in rural Shropshire in 1989; a\u00a0lynx was reportedly shot in Norwich in 1991; a spotted leopard was shot in the Isle of Wight in 1993; and another\u00a0lynx was captured alive in London in 2001. All of these animals are believed to have escaped from private collections or zoos.  Given that, phantom cat sightings no longer seem so outlandish.  Interestingly, none of these escapees were black. In fact, no conclusive evidence has ever been found to suggest that any of the large black cats, which feature in the majority of phantom cat sightings, have ever roamed wild in the UK \u2013 at least, not since the last of Britain's native leopards died out around 24,000 years ago.  > There are enough clues to keep the rumours alive  This has\u00a0led to speculation\u00a0that phantom cats are simply figments of people's imagination. Still, there are enough clues to keep the rumours alive.  News outlets occasionally publish photographs or videos, shot by members of the public, which supposedly show a big cat or another large feline. Most of these are far from convincing, with the supposed cat either too distant or obscured to properly identify. Some have even been revealed to be outright hoaxes.  But some of the visual evidence appears more convincing.  For example, one photograph, taken in Derbyshire in 2007, appears to be a large, black cat walking along a stone wall. The creature seems significantly larger than a domestic cat.  Similarly, a\u00a0video\u00a0filmed by a police officer in 2009 seems to show a large black animal \u2013 apparently feline \u2013 walking alongside a railway line in southern Scotland.  Governmental sources also claim to have observed exotic cats on camera in the UK.  In 2009, the Forestry Commission\u00a0disclosed\u00a0that its rangers had spotted big cats on two separate occasions in 2002 and in 2005, both in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. The animals were reportedly seen during a deer survey using heat-activated vision equipment. Unfortunately, if any images exist, they have never been made public.  > Scientists are now trying to detect the presence of phantom cats by searching for the mutilated prey that they allegedly leave behind  There are also people attempting to catch phantom cats on camera using a different approach. Members of the public have started deploying camera traps, which are remotely activated by motion, in an attempt to snap passing cats unawares.  One of these is Rick Minter, who writes about phantom cats. In 2016, Minter says he has set camera traps at various locations in southern England and Scotland where people claim to have seen big cats, or where landowners have reported sheep killings, which they believe may have been attacked by a large predator.  But although Minter says his traps have captured \"one or two\" photos that could show an exotic cat, his approach has yet to produce anything convincing.  In a different approach, rather than capturing the animals on film, scientists are now trying to detect the presence of phantom cats by searching for the mutilated prey that they allegedly leave behind.  In 2007\u00a0Ros Coard, a researcher at the University of Wales Lampeter (now the University of Wales Trinity Saint David), published a\u00a0study that drew a surprising conclusion: large cats could be hunting sheep in Wales.  > The spacing of the points suggested that some kind of cat, significantly larger than a domestic cat or wild cat, had bitten the sheep  Coard is an expert in the analysis of animal bite marks on bone. She examined the skeletal remains of a young sheep, which had been found dead in pastureland in southern Wales. The carcass \u2013 which was mostly defleshed and missing its entire spinal column \u2013 was sent to the university by a concerned landowner.  Coard found a tantalising clue that an exotic cat could have been to blame. On one of the sheep's bones, she found a tooth imprint with a three-pointed pattern, which closely resembled the type of imprint that would be left by the carnassial tooth of a large cat. These are a set of large back teeth, present in some carnivores, specifically adapted to shear flesh.  The carnassial teeth of many carnivorous mammals can leave this type of imprint, including foxes and domestic dogs, both of which are known to attack livestock in the UK. But Coard found that the spacing between the three points on the sheep bone was significantly larger than a dog or fox could produce. In fact, Coard concluded that the spacing of the points suggested that some kind of cat, significantly larger than a domestic cat or wild cat, had bitten the sheep.    Intriguingly, another scientist may also have found feline bite marks in animal carcasses elsewhere in the UK.  Andrew Hemmings, a lecturer at the Royal Agricultural University in Gloucester, has found tooth imprints in the carcasses of three animals. He believes these marks also match the shape of the teeth of a large cat.  > The tooth pit data certainly points to the presence of carnivores bigger than those indigenous to the UK  Hemmings discovered the imprints in two deer carcasses found in the Dorset heathlands, and a wild boar from the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. The findings have not yet been published in a scientific journal. However based on his analysis, Hemmings says that the tooth imprints in the three carcasses \"strongly resemble\" those of a big cat.  \"When considered alongside the wealth of reliable witness reports, the tooth pit data certainly points to the presence of carnivores bigger than those indigenous to the UK,\" he says.  Nothing captures the imagination quite like the possibility of big exotic cats living wild in the UK.  Many have been debunked as hoaxes or misidentifications, but there are a few of the 2,000 or so that are recorded every year that remain as mysteries. Recent scientific studies are also adding weight to the argument that something \u2013 or some things \u2013 may be out there.  Combined with the ongoing calls to reintroduce the once-native Eurasian lynx, the idea that large cats could be roaming the UK may not be that far-fetched.  **Read more:** _Could big cats be roaming the UK?_  This latest evidence is intriguing, but tooth imprints on their own will never be enough to settle the phantom cat debate. The same goes for the blurry photographic and video evidence, which is difficult to substantiate.  Until an oversized black cat crosses the path of a high-definition lens, or somehow wanders into a trap, these enigmatic creatures will remain phantoms.  _This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

Homer's _Odyssey_ recounts what happened after the sack of Troy, specifically Odysseus's epic voyage home. It might be fictional but according to the experts it still provides valuable insights into the reality of life in ancient times, including the flora and fauna.  Our hero's return encompasses ten years of island-hopping troubled by vengeful gods, ravenous monsters, seductive nymphs and trippy spells. It is a classic tale that has fascinated scholars since it was published in the 8th Century BC.  In true scientific style, researchers have scoured the text for meaning and dedicated themselves to explaining the most striking parts of the story. In some cases, the truth is remarkably close to the fiction.  **Lotus eaters**  One of the early wrong turns comes when strong northerly winds carry Odysseus off course to the land of the lotus-eaters. The sailors enjoy the local delicacy so much that they forget about returning home and Odysseus has to drag them back to the ships. There are multiple theories for what the lotus could be, such as strong wine or opium.  Another contender is a plant called _Diospyros lotus_ \u2013 the scientific name means \"fruit of the gods\". The fruits in question are round and yellow with succulent flesh that is said to taste like a cross between a date and a plum. That explains its common name: \"date plum\". But could tasty fruit be enough to convince Odysseus's men to stay put forever?  After a rough journey the hospitality and nutrition would no doubt be welcome, but another candidate for the irresistible lotus could explain its appeal. In his book _The Lotus Quest _plant expert Mark Griffiths identifies Homer's fruit as _Ziziphus lotus_, a jujube that reputedly has psychoactive properties.  Both species are well known at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew in London, but experts there put forward another possibility \u2013 the water lily (_Nymphaea_ sp.) that grows along the Nile.  This plant was frequently depicted in ancient Egyptian art and the blue variety (_N. __caerulea_) is particularly known as a narcotic. Consuming the plant is said to induce a state of peaceful apathy and it is classed as a banned substance in some European countries today. Whether its reputation was enough for Homer to have got wind of it on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea remains to be debated.  **Cyclops**  Searching for supplies on another island, Odysseus and some of his crew encounter Polyphemus, a man-eating giant. Several sailors perish before Odysseus eventually manages to blind the monster with a single stake to his only eye.  Possessing just one eye is a rarity among creatures with a backbone. In mammals, cyclopia is described as a congenital disorder where the orbits of the eyes fail to develop into two separate cavities. Associated complications for the brain, nose and respiratory system mean few born with the condition survive.  To address the \"giant\" aspect of the mythical cyclops, historian Adrienne Mayor of Stanford University, US, suggests the fossilised remains of ancient species could have provided inspiration. As farmers, the ancient Greeks would have explored the landscape and could have made some unusual discoveries. In particular, the skulls of dwarf elephants and mammoths have an enlarged nasal cavity that could have been mistaken for the sole eye-socket of a beastly foe.  \"Island caves do contain the unfamiliar fossils of dwarf mammoths, surrounded by heaps of mammal bones that in antiquity were taken as the bones of the one- eyed giant's victims,\" says Mayor.  Adrian Lister, a paleobiologist at the Natural History Museum, London, confirms that the remains of dwarf elephants have been found on many of the islands in the Mediterranean. He explains that the 10-tonne, 4-metre-high elephant _Palaeoloxodon antiquus _would have travelled from the mainland to the islands at times of low sea level. Once isolated, the elephants had to adapt to survive with less space and food and so became dwarfed.  \"In Sicily we have fossils of at least three different sizes of dwarf elephants,\" says Lister. \"The smallest\u00a0\u2013 _Palaeoloxodon falconeri_\u00a0\u2013 were among the smallest found anywhere. Many other islands in the Mediterranean have a similar story\u00a0\u2013 _P. antiquus_ got dwarfed to greater or lesser degrees. We find the dwarf elephants on Malta, Crete, Cyprus and several of the smaller Greek islands. Dwarf mammoths are rarer but we have them on Crete and Sardinia. For both the mammoths and the straight-tusked elephants, the smallest are around 1.2m (shoulder height) and 120 kg.\"  **Circe's magic**  When they are swept into the company of the sorceress Circe, the adventurers are drugged and penned up like swine. Fortunately Odysseus is protected from her spell by eating a holy herb called moly.  Botanists point to jimson weed (_Datura stramonium_) as the ingredient that makes the sailors act so strangely. The plant is related to belladonna and deadly nightshade, and contains toxic alkaloids that block neurotransmitters in the brain. If ingested, it causes hallucinations, delirium and amnesia as the brain struggles to send and receive messages.  Homer is quite specific in his description of moly: it has a black root and white flower. But that in itself is not an uncommon combination, so there has been much discussion over its identity. Based on its ability to neutralise the drug Circe dishes out, researchers believe the snowdrop_ (Galanthus nivalis) _is another very likely candidate.  The flower was known to grow in the region and contains the substance galantamine, which counteracts the effects of stramonium poisoning. Scientists have been studying it since the 1950s. It is now used in the treatment of Alzheimer's and dementia, because it can help to balance chemicals in the brain.  **Scylla**  The sailors take on even more terrible opponents when they pass through a narrow channel. They are confronted by Scylla, a multi-headed monster with attitude. Homer describes this cave-dwelling beast as possessing 12 legs and six necks, each with a ferocious man-eating head that sports three-rows of teeth.  Over time Scylla has been conflated with the kraken \u2013 all those necks and legs could after all, be tentacles. But giant squid are a rarity in the Mediterranean and besides, Scylla lives in a cave halfway up a cliff, which is no place for any ocean species.  Polycephaly is the biological term for having multiple heads. While it is rare in humans, it happens more frequently among reptiles. Damage to the embryo is thought to cause cells to duplicate so two heads grow, or to fuse so that twin embryos become partially combined.  Aristotle recorded a two-headed snake in 350 BC and the oldest surviving evidence is an embryonic lizard fossil from the Cretaceous of China. While the condition is often life-limiting for wild animals, it is possible Homer may have heard of it, or even witnessed it.  Then there is the use of snakes as biological weapons. There is at least one historical record of snakes being unleashed during a naval battle, by Hannibal fighting the Eumenes. Zoologist Gianni Insacco\u00a0of Milan's\u00a0Natural History Museum suggests the ancient Greeks might have employed this tactic too. He was part of the team that rediscovered the Javelin sand boa in Sicily, a species thought to have been introduced to the island by the Greeks for ritual and warfare purposes.  While there is no known Scylla monster, the poet skillfully combined stressed sailors, our unease with unusual biological development and the threat of snakes to create a monstrous cocktail.  **Charybdis**  Odysseus and his crew are officially between a rock and a hard place, because opposite Scylla lies Charybdis. This monstrous whirlpool regularly drinks down sea water and anything sailing upon it.  It might surprise you to learn that Charybdis was marked on naval charts into the 19th Century, just off the north-east tip of Sicily in the Strait of Messina. As a narrow passageway between the island of Sicily and the Italian peninsula, the area is well known for its strong winds and currents.  But it is the tidal activity in the strait that makes it a challenge for sailors. The tides in the Tyrrhenian Sea to the north of the channel are out of phase with the tides in the Ioanian Sea to the south. This results in turbulent water where they meet.  A submarine ridge in the Messina Straits also contributes to the turmoil, as currents pull cold water from the depths to the surface. Depending on the tidal activity, bore waves appear as well as whirlpools, also called vertical eddies. According to oceanographers, one of the larger ones develops off Capo del Faro, the place where Charybdis was historically marked.  While these hazards are navigable for most modern-day watercraft, they would have been riskier in Homer's time.  **Cattle of the Sun**  Odysseus and his crew eventually land on the island of Thrinacia, where the Sun god grazes his cattle. These animals are sacred but that does not stop the foolhardy crew hunting them when their supplies run short.  Academics have suggested that the island could be modern-day Sicily. There is evidence of both domesticated cattle and their wild relatives, aurochs (_Bos primigenius_) at Neolithic sites there, according to historian Jeremy McInernery of the University of Pennsylvania, US.  Of these two species, the wild aurochs is the more striking. It stood 1.5m at the withers (the highest part of its back) and certainly had the \"broad brow\" and large \"curving horns\" described by Homer. Also, cattle were highly valued in ancient Greece.  \"Evidence from many sites shows that in the Iron Age cattle were highly prized: for meat, for traction, and for by-products such as leather and probably tallow,\" says McInerney. \"Before coinage reached Greece in the 6th Century, cattle were a primary measure of wealth. In common with other pastoral societies, the Greeks prized cattle wealth: hence the emphasis on cattle raiding in the epic poems.\"  The punishment for pinching the Sun's cattle is therefore suitably brutal. Zeus destroys the ships and sailors with a thunderbolt and only Odysseus survives to tell his epic tale. Evidently, it is one we are still learning from today.  _Join over six million BBC Earth fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

While WW2 pilots like Douglas Bader and Guy Gibson became household names, Lacey's story is less well known.  With a nickname straight out of a Biggles adventure book, and a life story to match the fictional pilot, Ginger Lacey went from learning to fly to becoming one of the heroes of the Battle of Britain in just three years.  One of \"The Few\", Lacey downed at least 28 enemy planes during World War Two and was a rare example of someone who served in the RAF on both the first and final day of the war.  Due to both skill and luck, in his own words, he survived nine crash landings and famously shot down a German plane that had just bombed Buckingham Palace.  Lacey died in 1989 and his achievements have been honoured with a blue plaque on the land where his childhood home once stood in Wetherby, West Yorkshire.  The site is now home to an Aldi supermarket, with the plaque displayed at the store's entrance.  \"Dad would have enjoyed the irony,\" said his daughter Min Lacey.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p0599lkd.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionGinger Lacey was one of the pilots described as the \"backbone of RAF Fighter Command\"  Born on 1 February 1917 at Fairfield Villas in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, Lacey had a rural upbringing, with his father adamant he would join the family business.  Ms Lacey, 57, said: \"He desperately wanted to join the RAF, but his dad wanted him to be a farmer - it wasn't until his father died that he managed to convince his mum.  \"He was a pale and skinny kid and his mum thought he would fail the medical, but of course he didn't.\"  While working as a trainee pharmacist in Leeds, Lacey learnt to fly with the RAF Volunteer Reserve at weekends and became an instructor at the Yorkshire Flying School in Yeadon in 1938.  As war broke out in 1939, he had amassed 1,000 hours of flight time and was sent to France as an RAF flight sergeant to support the British troops.

Gordon Leith, curator at the Royal Air Force Museum, said: \"It was a critical time. Following the defeat at Dunkirk they must have been aware that invasion was impending and a lot depended on their efforts.\"  As the Luftwaffe started to bomb airfields and factories, Lacey was ordered back to Britain and was stationed at Gravesend Airport for the majority of the Battle of Britain.  * * *  **Ginger Lacey's thoughts on the Luftwaffe, from a 1978 **BBC radio interview  _We called them bandits... which meant either unidentified or enemy aircraft. It was never meant to describe the people in it or anything like that. _  _I much preferred to kill someone without them even knowing I was there - the first indication he was being shot at was when bullets were coming out of his chest. _  _You were there to get rid of his aeroplane, it didn't cross your mind that it was a man You were firing at an aeroplane of a different kind wearing the wrong markings and flying in our sky. _  _We had been told to get rid of them, so we got rid of them; there was no feeling about it._  _ I didn't go round hating Germans or liking Germans. I had never met a German in my life so I couldn't have any preconceived opinion of what one looked like, acted like or sounded like._  * * *  In a 1978 BBC interview, he recalled waking up in a hut by the runway as the pilots waited for the phone to ring.  \"You would have a cup of tea, some breakfast, you would go out to your aircraft, a couple of hundred yards, check the aircraft, get our parachutes out, fit our helmets in the aircraft, hang them over the control column and make ourselves as comfortable as possible waiting for the first call,\" Lacey said.

Asked by the BBC's Norman Tozer how he ended up still alive and holding one of Britain's highest \"scores\" of the battle, Lacey said it was down to experience and \"an awful lot of luck\".  \"I was shot down nine times in 16 weeks. Twice I got out with my aeroplane burning from end to end, once with no tail on it,\" he said.  \"When someone has done that to your plane, you've got to have had a lot of luck to have avoided the bullets which mangled the aeroplane.\"  ##  Battle of Britain  ###  July to October 1940  1,023  aircraft lost by RAF  1,887  aircraft lost by Luftwaffe    * 3,000 aircrew served with RAF Fighter Command     * 20% were from the British Dominions and occupied European or neutral countries     * 544 RAF Fighter Command pilots were killed     * 2,500 Luftwaffe aircrew were killed   Source: RAF  His daughter thinks his survival and hit rate was down to his shooting skills, with ammunition in short supply at the time.  She said: \"He was a very good marksman, he brought down aircraft with five shots, so he was never going to run out of ammunition, was he?  \"He was also able to conquer sheer terror day after day: can you imagine being in that tiny cockpit, frozen, terrified, doing seven flights a day and not knowing if you were going to come back from any of them?\"  During the Blitz, Lacey was scrambled to stop a Heinkel He 111 plane that had flown above the capital and bombed Buckingham Palace.  \"He was injured when the rear gunner fired back at him and he had to crash land. He was actually forced to glide the aircraft back to Gravesend,\" Mr Leith said.

The creature was called Mokele-mbembe and was a prehistoric monster of some kind. It was said to be much like a sauropod; a long-necked dinosaur. But Regusters had a hunch it was still out there.  He decided he wanted to go to a poorly-mapped part of Africa, which now lies within the Republic of Congo, and find the beast himself. After trying unsuccessfully to get his employer and the US Department of Defense to pay for the trip, by arguing that useful maps could be made of the region, Regusters planned to fund the venture himself with the help of some private donors.  Regusters' wife Kia accompanied him and, along with a team of locals, he ventured to the remote freshwater Lake Tele. But, like many others before and since, the American explorer came back with little more than some entertaining stories, which he recounted in talks and written reports.  He claimed several sightings, but there were no photos or videos. In fact, one instance was apparently witnessed by the whole team \"except the photographer\", Regusters later wrote.  The trip had not been easy. The explorers were beset by sweat bees, had trudged through miles of swamp, endured hot days and uncomfortably cool, wet nights, and survived on locally-caught game such as monkey meat. Still, they were determined to find the monster.  Western references to Mokele-mbembe mostly date to the early 20th Century. German and French visitors to the region told tales inherited from local people about a great monster that lived out in the forest. The details in each report were quite variable.  In some it was truly gigantic \u2013 an elephant-eater \u2013 while in others it was not much bigger than a hippo. Some mentioned a snakelike head; others said it had a hump.  > One instance was apparently witnessed by the whole team \"except the photographer\"  Any documentary evidence gathered seemed prone to disaster. Photographic film was destroyed, sketches were burned, and audio was riddled with noise.  But that is perhaps the enduring appeal of Mokele-mbembe. It is said to live in such a remote and inhospitable part of the world that some people still cling to the possibility that it is out there. Are they right?  The answer, according to Paul Barrett, a palaeontologist at London's Natural History Museum, is a resounding \"no\". There is no way that a sauropod-like creature could still exist without humans being aware of it, he says.  \"We have no evidence in the fossil record for the last 66 million years for anything that looks like a sauropod anywhere in the world,\" he says.  Even setting aside dinosaurs, a really big land or lake animal, of whatever sort, is unlikely to be hiding in the African jungle. Humans have not discovered a creature that weighs more than a tonne for at least half a century, notes Barrett.  \"Big animals need big populations to keep going,\" he says. \"They also need large geographic ranges to fulfil their feeding needs.\"  > That just wipes out this idea that you could expect ancient relics in Africa  The idea that one or two giants are hiding out in Lake Tele just does not make sense.  Darren Naish, a science writer and palaeontologist, agrees. Some cryptozoologists who believe in Mokele-mbembe say that prehistoric creatures could have persisted in Africa because it is so \"unchanged\". But, as Naish points out, this is a mistaken view. Flora and fauna on the continent have gone through a wide catalogue of changes, up to and after the dinosaurs.  \"Even the rainforests, they waxed and waned substantially over the years,\" he says. \"They're geologically young things, so that just wipes out this idea that you could expect [ancient] relics in Africa.\"  But could some of the stories told to local explorers relate to some other large creature that once lived in the area?  Perhaps, says Naish. Some now think an extinct species of rhino used to inhabit land near to Lake Tele. Stories of it could have been passed down and changed over time.  > Local discoveries of fossils or footprints could have inspired myths about their origin  Some of these animals could also have been mistaken for Mokele-mbembe or something like it, Naish adds. Hippos, crocodiles, large turtles, swimming elephants \u2013 even odd-shaped logs floating around could be misinterpreted.  Perhaps the most intriguing thing is that this is not an unusual story. Aside from Mokele-mbembe and Scotland's long-rumoured Loch Ness Monster, there are other such tales. There is reportedly a \"Bessie\" in Lake Erie in North America and \"Tessie\" in Lake Tahoe, a \"Bownessie\" in England and \"Kussie\" in Japan. It seems that many lakes have monsters to go with them.  Barrett suggests one possible reason. Some age-old stories could be the relics of warnings from parents trying to keep their children from drowning. If children stay clear of a lake \"monster\" they will, in theory, be safer.  > In the early 1900s, there was something of a \"dinosaur craze\"  Local discoveries of fossils or footprints could have inspired myths about their origin, says Martin Sander at the University of Bonn in Germany, who has written several papers on sauropods. He gives a good example: the \"snakestones\" of England.  These are ammonite fossils with a snake's head carved into them by humans, which give the impression of a coiled reptile. They were said to be the remnants of snakes turned to stone by St Hilda in the 7th Century. In reality, they are simply fossils that have been tampered with.  As for the Mokele-mbembe stories, the era in which they were reported by Western explorers may have been a key factor, says Naish. In the early 1900s, there was something of a \"dinosaur craze\", he says. \"It was bigger than [_Jurassic Park_].\"  What's more, Sander notes that several references come from a well-known animal dealer called Carl Hagenbeck in 1909, as an apparent publicity stunt. Hagenbeck reported stories about Mokele-mbembe that he had heard from others. \"He would have known about these German palaeontological excavations [in the region]. He was a hunter but he also ran the Hamburg Zoo,\" says Sander.  > Any expedition to uncover the unknown has the potential to yield interesting and unexpected findings  What's more, a long-running assumption about the monster is that it is a lake and swamp-dweller. This is the sort of life that people thought sauropods enjoyed one hundred years ago, but we now believe that they generally stuck to dry land. The fact that old speculations have got caught up with the Mokele- mbembe myth is another reason to doubt that these stories were ever grounded in fact.  Despite that, there is still value in such myths, says Barrett. Any expedition to uncover the unknown has the potential to yield interesting and unexpected findings. As long as trained field biologists are present to capture a true record of anything out of the ordinary, should it rear its head from murky waters.  _Join over six million BBC Earth fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

It's mostly about his relationship with his ex-wife Jane, but it does find a bit of time to explain what Hawking has spent his career doing.  He certainly didn't lack ambition. Hawking has been one of many physicists trying to come up with a \"theory of everything\", a single theory that will explain everything about our universe. He was following in the footsteps of Albert Einstein, who tried and failed to devise such a theory.  Finding a theory of everything would be a staggering achievement, finally making sense of all the weird and wonderful things in our universe. For decades, confident physicists have said that one is just around the corner. So are we really on the verge of understanding everything?  On the face of it, a theory of everything sounds like a tall order. It would have to explain everything from the works of Shakespeare to the human brain and the forests and valleys of our natural world, says John Barrow of the University of Cambridge in the UK. \"That's the question of the universe.\"  Nevertheless, Barrow thinks finding a theory of everything \"is quite conceivable\". That's because \"the laws of nature are rather few, they're simple and symmetrical and there are only four fundamental forces.\"  In a way we have to put aside the complexity of the world we live in. \"The outcomes of the laws - the things that we see around us - are infinitely more complicated,\" says Barrow. But the rules underlying it all may be simple.  In 1687, it seemed to many scientists that a theory of everything had been found.  > Newton was walking in a garden when he saw an apple fall from a tree  The English physicist Isaac Newton published a book in which he explained how objects move, and set out how gravity works. The _Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ \u2013 that's \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\" to you and me \u2013 presented the world as a beautiful, ordered place.  The story goes that, at the age of 23, Newton was walking in a garden when he saw an apple fall from a tree. At the time, physicists knew that the Earth somehow pulled objects down by the force of gravity. Newton would take this idea further.  According to John Conduitt, his assistant in later years, seeing the apple fall led Newton to the idea that the gravitational force \"was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought\". According to Conduitt's account, Newton then asked: \"Why not as high as the Moon?\"  Inspired, Newton developed a law of gravity, which worked equally well for apples on Earth and planets orbiting the Sun.\u00a0 All these objects, which seemed so different, turned out to obey the same laws.  In the same book, Newton set out three laws governing how objects move. Combined with the law of gravity, these laws explained how a ball moves when you throw it and why the Moon orbits the Earth.  \"People thought that he had explained everything there was to explain,\" says Barrow. \"His achievement was immense.\"  The problem was, Newton knew his work had holes.  For instance, gravity doesn't explain how small objects hold themselves together, as the force isn't strong enough.\u00a0 Also, while Newton could describe what was happening, he couldn't explain how it worked. The theory was incomplete.  > Mercury wasn't playing ball  But there was a bigger problem. While Newton's laws explained most of the common phenomena in the universe, in some cases objects broke his laws. These situations were rare, and generally involved extreme speeds or powerful gravity, but they were there.  One such circumstance was the orbit of Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun. As each planet orbits the Sun it also rotates. Newton's laws could be used to calculate how they should rotate, but Mercury wasn't playing ball. Equally strangely, its orbit was off-centre.  The evidence was clear. Newton's universal law of gravitation wasn't universal, and wasn't a law.  Over two centuries later, Albert Einstein came to the rescue with his theory of general relativity. \u00a0Einstein's idea, which in 2015 celebrates its 100th anniversary, offered a much deeper understanding of gravity.  > Really heavy objects like planets, or really fast-moving ones, can distort space-time  The core idea is that space and time, which seem like different things, are actually interwoven. Space has its three dimensions: length, breadth and height. Then there is a fourth dimension, which we call time. All four are linked in a kind of giant cosmic sheet. If you've ever heard a character in a science fiction movie mention \"the space-time continuum\", this is what they're talking about.  Einstein's big idea was that really heavy objects like planets, or really fast-moving ones, can distort space-time. It's a bit like the taut fabric of a trampoline: if you put a heavy weight on it, the fabric bows and curves. Any other objects will then roll down the sheet towards the object. This, according to Einstein, is why gravity pulls objects towards each other.  This is a deeply weird idea. But physicists are convinced that it is true. For one thing, it explains the strange orbit of Mercury.  According to general relativity, the Sun's huge mass warps space and time around it.  As the closest planet to the sun, Mercury experiences much bigger distortions than any of the other planets.\u00a0 The equations of general relativity describe how this warped space-time should affect Mercury's orbit, and predict the planet's position down to a tee.  But despite this success, general relativity isn't a theory of everything, any more than Newton's theories were. Just as Newton's theory didn't work for really massive objects, Einstein's didn't work on the very small.  Once you start looking at tiny things like atoms, matter starts to behave very oddly indeed.  Up until the late 19th century, the atom was thought to be the smallest unit of matter. Coming from the Greek _atomos_ meaning \"indivisible\", the atom by its very definition was not supposed to be able to be divided into smaller particles.  But in the 1870s, scientists found particles that were almost 2000 times lighter than atoms.  > Scientists have found ways to divide matter smaller and smaller  By weighing light rays in a vacuum tube, they found extraordinarily light, negatively-charged particles. This was the first discovery of a subatomic particle: the electron.  In the next half-century scientists discovered that the atom had a nucleus hub, which the electrons buzzed around. This hub \u2013 which was by far the heaviest part of the atom \u2013 was made up of two types of subatomic particles: neutrons, which are neutrally charged and protons, which are positively charged.  But it didn't stop there. Since this time, scientists have found ways to divide matter smaller and smaller, continuing to redefine our notion of fundamental particles. By the 1960s, scientists had found dozens of elementary particles, drawing up a long list known as the particle zoo.  As we understand it today, of the three components of an atom, electrons are the only fundamental particles. Neutrons and protons can be divided further into teeny, tiny particles called \"quarks\".  > Einstein never really believed in quantum theory  These subatomic particles were governed by an entirely different set of laws than those governing big objects like trees or planets.\u00a0 And these new laws \u2013 which were far less predictable - threw a spanner in the works.  In quantum physics, particles don't have defined locations: their whereabouts is a bit fuzzy.\u00a0 All we can say is that each particle has a certain probability of being in each location. This means the world is a fundamentally uncertain place.  This may all seem very unfathomable and far-out. All we can say is, it's not just you that feels that way. The physicist Richard Feynman, an expert on the quantum, once said: \"I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.\"  Einstein was also disturbed by the fuzziness of quantum mechanics. \"Despite having instigated it, Einstein never really believed in quantum theory,\" says Barrow.  All the same, for their respective domains \u2013 the big and the small \u2013 both general relativity and quantum mechanics have proven, time and time again, to be tremendously accurate.  Quantum physics has explained the structure and behaviour of atoms, including why some of them are radioactive. It also underlies all modern electronics. You could not read this article without it.  Meanwhile general relativity was used to predict the existence of black holes. These are stars so massive that they have collapsed in on themselves. Their gravitational attraction is so powerful that nothing \u2013 not even light \u2013 can escape from it.    But the issue is, the two theories are not compatible, so they can't both be right. General relativity says that objects' behaviours can be predicted exactly, whereas quantum mechanics says all you can know is the probability that they will do something.  That means there are some things physicists still can't describe. Black holes are a particular problem. They are massive so general relativity applies, but they are also small so quantum mechanics applies too.  Unless you're close to a black hole, this incompatibility doesn't affect your day-to-day life. But it has perplexed physicists for most of the last century. It's this incompatibility that has driven the quest for a theory of everything.  Einstein spent much of his life trying to find such a theory. Never a fan of the randomness of quantum mechanics, he wanted to create a theory that would bring together gravity and the rest of physics, with all the quantum weirdness as a secondary consequence.  > Einstein spent 30 years on a fruitless quest  His major challenge was to make gravity work with electromagnetism. In the 1800s, physicists had worked out that electrically-charged particles could be attracted or repelled by each other. That's why some metals are attracted to magnets. This meant there were two kinds of force that objects could exert on each other: they could attract each other with their gravity, and either attract or repel with their electromagnetism.  Einstein wanted to bring the two forces together into a \"unified field theory\". To do this, he extended his space-time to five dimensions. As well as the three of space and one of time, he added a fifth dimension that was so small and curled up we couldn't see it.  This didn't work out, and Einstein spent 30 years on a fruitless quest. He died in 1955, his unified field theory still undiscovered. But in the following decade, the strongest contender for a theory of everything emerged: string theory.  The idea behind string theory is oddly simple. The basic ingredients of the world, such as electrons, are not actually particles at all. Instead they are little loops or \"strings\". It's just that these strings are so small, they seem to be mere points.  > All the different particles discovered in the 20th century are really the same kinds of strings  Just like the strings on a guitar, these loops are under tension. That means they vibrate at different frequencies, depending on their size.  In turn, these oscillations determine what sort of \"particle\" each string appears to be. Vibrate a string one way and you get an electron. Vibrate it another way, and you get something else. All the different particles discovered in the 20th century are really the same kinds of strings, just vibrating in different ways.  It may not be immediately obvious why this is a good idea. But it seems to make sense of all the forces acting in nature: gravity and electromagnetism, plus two that were only discovered in the 20th century.  The strong and weak nuclear forces are only active within the tiny nuclei of atoms, which is why it took so long for anyone to notice them. The strong force holds the nucleus together. The weak force normally does nothing, but if it gets strong enough it breaks the nucleus apart: this is why some atoms are radioactive.  > For the first time, general relativity and quantum mechanics had found common ground  Any theory of everything would have to explain all four. Fortunately, the two nuclear forces and electromagnetism are all covered by quantum mechanics. Each is carried by a specialized particle. But there's no particle to carry the force of gravity.  Some physicists think there is. They call this particle the \"graviton\". Gravitons would have to have no mass, spin in a particular way, and travel at the speed of light. Unfortunately, nobody has ever managed to find one.  This is where string theory comes in. It describes a string that looks exactly like a graviton: it spins in the right way, is massless and travels at the speed of light. For the first time, general relativity and quantum mechanics had found common ground.  As a result, in the mid-1980s physicists became hugely excited about string theory. \"In 1985 we realised string theory solved a lot of the problems people had struggled with for the last 50 years,\" says Barrow. But it also has a host of problems.  For starters, \"we don't really understand what string theory is in full detail,\" according to Philip Candelas of the University of Oxford in the UK. \"We don't have a good way to describe it.\"  It also makes some predictions that seem outright bizarre. While Einstein's unified field theory relied on a single hidden extra dimension, the earliest forms of string theory called for a total of 26 dimensions. These had to be there to make the mathematics consistent with what we already know about the universe.  More advanced versions, known as \"superstring theories\", get by with just 10 dimensions. But even that is a far cry from the three dimensions we see on Earth.  \"The way we reconcile this is by saying that only three expanded in our world and became large,\" says Barrow. \"The others are there but remain fantastically small.\"  Because of these and other problems, many physicists are unconvinced by string theory. Some have instead studied another theory: loop quantum gravity.  > Loop quantum gravity proposes that space-time is actually divided into small chunks  This isn't an attempt at an overarching theory that incorporates particle physics. Instead, loop quantum gravity just sets out to find a quantum theory of gravity. It's more limited than string theory \u2013 but it's also not as unwieldy.  Loop quantum gravity proposes that space-time is actually divided into small chunks. When you zoom out it appears to be a smooth sheet, but when you zoom in, it is a bunch of dots connected by lines or loops. These small fibres, which are woven together, offer an explanation for gravity.  This idea is just as boggling as string theory, and it has the same problem: there's no hard experimental evidence.  Why do these theories keep stumbling? One possibility is that we simply don't know enough yet. If there are major phenomena that we've never even seen, we are trying to understand the big picture while missing half the pieces.  \"It's very tempting to think we've discovered everything,\" says Barrow. \"But it would be very suspicious if in the year 2015 we could make all the observations necessary to have a theory of everything.\u00a0 Why should it be us?\"  > For all its problems, string theory still looks promising  There's also a more immediate problem. The theories are really difficult to test, largely because the maths is so fiendish. Candelas has struggled for years to find a way to test string theory, so far without success.  \"The main obstacle to the advancement of string theory is there's not enough maths known to advance the study of physics,\" says Barrow. \"It's such an early stage and there's so much to explore.\"  For all its problems, string theory still looks promising. \"For many years people have been trying to unify gravity with the rest of physics,\" says Candelas. \"We had theories that explained electromagnetism and the other forces well, but not gravity. With string theory we put them together.\"  The real problem is that a theory of everything may simply be impossible to identify.  When string theory became popular in the 1980s, there were actually five different versions of it. \"People began to worry,\" says Barrow. \"If there's a theory of everything, why are there five of them?\"  Over the next decade, physicists discovered that these theories could be transformed into each other. They were different ways of looking at the same thing.  > M-theory doesn't offer a single theory of everything  The end result was M-theory, put forward in 1995. This is a deeper version of string theory, incorporating all the earlier versions. That looks good: at least we're back to a single theory. M-theory also only needs 11 dimensions, which is at least better than 26.  But M-theory doesn't offer a single theory of everything. It offers billions upon billions of them. In total, M-theory gives us 10 to the power of 500 theories, all of them logically consistent and capable of describing a universe.  That looks worse than useless, but many physicists now think it points to a deeper truth.  The simplest conclusion is that our universe is one of many, each of them described by one of the trillions of versions of M-theory. This huge collection of universes is called the \"multiverse\".  At the beginning of time, the multiverse was like \"a great foam of bubbles, all slightly different shapes and sizes,\" says Barrow. Each bubble then expanded into its own universe.  \"We're in just one of those bubbles,\" says Barrow. As the bubbles expand, other bubbles can arise inside them, each one a new universe. \"It's making the geography of the universe really complicated.\"  Within each bubble universe, the same physical laws will apply. That's why everything in our universe seems to behave the same.  > There are trillions of other universes, each one unique  But the rules will be different in other universes. \"The laws we see in our universe are just like bylaws,\" says Barrow. \"They govern our bit, but not all of the universes.\"  This leads us to a strange conclusion. If string theory really is the best way to combine general relativity and quantum mechanics, then it both is and isn't a theory of everything.  On the one hand, string theory may give us a perfect description of our own universe. But it also seems to lead, inescapably, to the idea that there are trillions of other universes, each one unique.  \"The big change in thinking is we don't expect there to be a unique theory of everything,\" says Barrow. \"There are so many possible theories they're almost filling every possibility of thinking.\"", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Will we ever have a theory of everything?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150409-can-science-ever-explain-everything", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "New Zealand", "Australia"], "author": "Katie Silver"},{"newsText": "A man was charged after tests showed the victim died of multiple stab wounds.    * 23 July 2017    * From the section Suffolk", "newsHeadline": "Suffolk - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/england/suffolk", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "In one cataclysmic night, the gods sent a battalion of fire and earthquakes so intense that the Utopian kingdom of Atlantis sank deep into the ocean, never to be found again.  So tells Plato's infamous myth, which has captivated audiences for more than 2,300 years. Many people have subsequently floated theories about exactly where Atlantis was: in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Spain, even under Antarctica. A popular idea is that the Atlantis myth is associated with the fate of Thera, now the Greek island of Santorini, which was partly destroyed by a volcanic eruption about 3,600 years ago. But many, if not most, scientists think we will never tie Atlantis to a real location.  \"I don't think there's any question that the story of Atlantis is a myth,\" says Patrick Nunn, a geologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia.  But Atlantis is not the only legend of a sunken city. Similar tales are told around the world, and it now seems that some of them are true.  Plato was living in a volcanically and tectonically active part of the world where massive earthquakes and tsunamis were not usual.  > These myths provide a window upon those events that can be recovered, retrieved and even dated  \"He observed what was going on and he used details from these observations to make his narrative about Atlantis sound more credible,\" says Nunn. \"But, I think, there's no way that we could consider Atlantis as a particular place.\"  Despite Nunn's scepticism about this ill-fated kingdom, he is one of a growing band of geologists who have begun to take an interest in similar myths in the belief that some really can shed light on ancient geological events.  In 1966, the scientist Dorothy Vitaliano coined a name for the discipline: geomythology. It is, she said, the science of \"seeking to find the real geological event underlying a myth or legend to which it has given rise\".  \"Myths are largely event-based, in that they are triggered to a large part by an event, or combination of events, that catastrophically impact society,\" says Bruce Masse, an environmental archaeologist, who co-edited a volume on the subject. \"Then these myths provide a window upon those events that can be recovered, retrieved and even dated.\"  A close inspection of such \"geomyths\" has revealed valuable information \u2013 a date for the most recent eruption of the volcano Nabukelevu in Fiji, for example.  And scientists have no shortage of myths, or geological events, to ponder: stories of volcanoes and earthquakes abound, as do tales of catastrophic floods and lands submerged under the sea.  When Nunn heard the story of another lost island, Teonimanu in the Solomon Islands of the South Pacific, he was instantly intrigued. \"It was high land, it wasn't a low atoll or reef island just made of sand that could be easily washed away,\" Nunn says. \"It was a substantial island that disappeared.\"  > Waves can't wash away islands, particularly islands that are high and volcanic  The tale tells of the cuckolded husband Roraimenu, whose wife Sauwete'au went to live with another man on the island of Teonimanu. An enraged Roraimenu purchased a wave curse to seek his revenge and travelled to the island of Teonimanu, with four waves attached to the front of his canoe, and four on the rear.  Once ashore, he planted two taro plants, kept another and beat a hasty retreat to his own island of Ali'ite. The curse stated that when the leaves sprouted on his taro plant, the onslaught would start. On that day, Roraimenu watched from a mountaintop as the eight waves surged on Teonimanu, one by one, until it sank, never to be seen again.  Nunn interprets the waves in the story as a description of a tsunami train \u2013 many tsunamis consist of a series of waves. \"But of course, waves can't wash away islands, particularly islands that are high and volcanic,\" Nunn says.  It was actually a sea-floor earthquake that geologists believe took the island, which had always teetered on the edge of a steep, undersea slope. Once the tremors shook the foundations, a large landslide carried Teonimanu underwater, which likely generated a tsunami train in the process.  > Entire islands could disappear  For the people that survived, and lived to tell, and retell, the tale, the waves and the island's destruction are inextricably linked. \"So you actually get the island subsiding, or sinking, abruptly at the same time as the waves are generated,\" Nunn says. \"For an uninformed observer, of course, it's logical to connect the two.\"  Nunn had encountered similar myths, but he had interpreted them as descriptions of lost populations of people who had lived on the islands \u2013 not the literal loss of the islands themselves.  In fact, there is still some scientific scepticism about the ability of entire islands to slip beneath the sea in the way that Nunn thinks Teonimanu did. But Nunn points out that the volume of material in an island such as Teonimanu is still a lot less than the amount that moves in large terrestrial landslides.  What's more, surveys conducted of the sea floor in the region have revealed submerged debris that could be evidence of the loss of a number of islands, with older islands further down the slope. \"This made it clear to me that entire islands could disappear,\" Nunn says.  > Large waves came on land and washed away the places that people were living in  No less dramatic are ancient stories of coastal cities being lost to the waves. Several are described in ancient Sanskrit texts, including the Mahabharata, a 4000-year-old poem that has the honour of being the longest epic narrative in world literature. The Mahabharata and another Sanskrit epic \u2013 the Ramayana \u2013 were originally written on palm leaves.  A tale in the Mahabharata tells how Lord Krishna, following a battle victory, decided to leave the city of Dwaraka for his heavenly abode. The Arabian Sea then submerged it. Although long believed to be no more than a mythical kingdom, a 1963 archaeological investigation discovered Dwaraka intact, under the sea, on India's Saurashtra coast.  Similar stories exist about the city of Poompuhar and ancient ruins at the city of Mahabalipuram. Both are also now known also to have existed: the Mahabalipuram ruins \"reappeared\" after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.\u00a0\"When you look at these places, they're all saying the same thing,\" Nunn says. \"That large waves came on land and washed away the places that people were living in.\"  But Nunn believes that tsunamis alone don't account for the submergence and subsequent abandonment of such cities.  Instead he believes that the steady creep of post-glacial sea level rise slowly claimed the coastal lands and the tsunamis merely finished off the job.  > Huge masses of ice started to melt and pour waters into the world's oceans  \"If the sea level is rising, and you have these kinds of extreme waves superimposed on a rising sea level, then clearly one day those waves are going to have an effect that they wouldn't have if the sea level wasn't rising,\" he says.  But tales about these less glamorous, tortoise-paced inundations are few and far between. \"We humans like disaster stories but adapting to gradual change doesn't sell so well,\" says Martin Bates, a geoarchaeologist at University of Wales Trinity Saint David.  That is, unless you are an Aborigine living on the coast of Australia.  Around 20,000 years ago, at the coldest time of the last ice age, the sea level was about 120 metres below its present level.  > People must have been aware that every year the sea was on the rise  But as temperatures rose, huge masses of ice started to melt and pour waters into the world's oceans. During the next 13,000 years, sea levels gradually rose to reach their current levels.  \"We think Australia was abuzz with talk about this as it would have been a major concern,\" says Nicholas Reid, a linguist at the University of New England in Australia.  Aboriginal societies have probably existed in Australia for around 65,000 years, isolated until the European colonisation in 1788. Australia was undoubtedly a hard environment to live in, and survival through the generations depended on passing down information about food, the landscape and the climate from one generation to another.  Reid teamed up with Nunn, and between them they searched through documented Aboriginal Australian stories for tales describing times when sea levels were lower than today, or rising. They found 21 such stories from different locations around the Australian coast describing landscapes that had become submerged, never to re-emerge.  > The idea that you can transmit anything over 400 generations is extraordinary  In regions of Australia where the coastal land had a low topography, even a small rise in sea level would have claimed large chunks of land relatively quickly.  \"People must have been aware that every year the sea was on the rise,\" Reid says. \"And they must have had stories from their fathers and grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, that the sea used to be out even further.\"  Some of these stories are pragmatic descriptions of a time when sea levels were lower, such as memories of the loss of kangaroo hunting grounds around Port Phillip Bay near Melbourne.  Others are more figurative. In one such story an ancestral character, Ngurunderi, chased his wives who attempted to flee to Kangaroo Island on foot. In his anger, Ngurunderi summoned the seas to rise, separating the island from the mainland and turning the women into rocks that now jut out of the water.  By connecting each story with the specific geological event it describes, the researchers believe they could date some of the narratives as between 7,000 and 10,000 years old.  \"If you are talking about 10,000 years you are really talking about 300 to 400 generations,\" Reid says. \"The idea that you can transmit anything over 400 generations is extraordinary.\"  Scientists have previously thought that the accuracy of such stories could not persist for much more than 800 years without being written down. But Reid believes a key feature of Indigenous storytelling culture \u2013 a \"cross- generational cross-checking\" process \u2013 could explain the stories endurance through the millennia.  In this process, a father will pass down the story to his children \u2013 and their nephews and nieces are responsible for ensuring the children know those stories correctly.  > If we don't collect these narratives in the next 20 years or so, then they will completely disappear  \"This mechanism constitutes a scaffolding across generations that makes the replication of story telling with high degrees of accuracy possible,\" Reid says.  The researchers believe that the sheer isolation of Australia may also have played into the stories' ability to survive intact. In terms of the movement of people Australia has been a stable continent, and there have been no invading armies.  \"These stories do describe a time when the sea came up, inundated the continental shelf so that people lost land that they had previously lived on,\" Reid says. \"These stories are the responses to that and they are still being told in 2015.\"  But whether stories that have endured for 7,000 years or more will continue to be told is an issue that concerns Nunn.  In aboriginal and Pacific Island communities, some members of the younger generation are not learning their native languages and they are less interested in cultural traditions.  \"They prefer downloading a new ringtone, or something similar, to listening to their grandparents' stories that don't sound credible anyway,\" Nunn says. \"What I fear is that if we don't collect these narratives in the next 20 years or so, then they will completely disappear.\"  > If someone says, 'I saw this happen and this is how it happened', that's incredible  That cell phones can arrest the spread of stories that have stood for millennia is rather galling, and for geomythologists it could mean the irretrievable loss of vital information.  It might also have a detrimental impact on island and coastal communities, because Nunn believes that cultural myths relating to sea level rise could help galvanise local participation in adaptation strategies to current climate change. Sea level rise myths might even contain clues about the kinds of adaptations that could help coastal communities.  Perhaps, most importantly of all, myths can provide a form of validation for geological events that simply cannot be confirmed by current scientific methods.  \"As geoscientists, we look back into the past and infer that things happened but we can't prove that they happened,\" Nunn says. \"But if someone says, 'I saw this happen and this is how it happened', that's incredible. It's the best corroboration that you can get.\"", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The Atlantis-style myths that turned out to be true", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160118-the-atlantis-style-myths-of-sunken-lands-that-are-really-true", "countriesMentioned": ["Australia", "British Indian Ocean Territory", "United Kingdom", "Antarctica", "Fiji", "Spain", "United States", "India", "South Africa", "Panama"], "author": "Jane Palmer"},{"newsText": "When we think about whether or not aliens exist, we generally imagine them on a vaguely Earth-like planet circling a distant star. We do not normally think of them living out in space itself.  But maybe that is not such a ridiculous idea. In April 2016, researchers reported that some of the key building blocks of life can be produced from simple substances under harsh conditions mimicking those of interstellar space.  Cornelia Meinert at the University of Nice, France and colleagues showed that a mixture of frozen water, methanol and ammonia \u2013 all compounds known to exist in the vast \"molecular clouds\" from which stars form \u2013 can be transformed into a wide range of sugar molecules when exposed to ultraviolet rays, which pervade space. The sugars included ribose, which is a part of the DNA-like molecule RNA.  This suggests that the fundamental molecules of life might be formed in outer space, and then delivered to planets like Earth by icy comets and meteorites.  The finding is actually not surprising. We have known for decades that other building blocks of life can be formed from chemical reactions like this, before being incorporated into comets, asteroids and planets.  However, there is a more intriguing possibility. Life itself might not have needed a warm and comfortable planet bathed in sunlight to get going. If the raw ingredients were already out there in interplanetary limbo, might life have started there too?  Ideas about the origins of life do not often consider this scenario. It is hard enough to figure out how life could have begun on the early Earth, let alone at temperatures close to absolute zero and the near vacuum of interstellar space.  > There is no fundamental reason why life might not arise far from any star  Making the basic building blocks of life, like sugars and amino acids, is the easy part. There are lots of chemically-  plausible ways to do that, starting with the simple molecules found in young solar systems.  The hard bit is persuading these complicated molecules to assemble into something capable of life-sustaining processes like replication and metabolism. Nobody has ever done this, or come up with a completely plausible way it might happen, in the nurturing environment of a warm, rocky planet \u2013 let alone in space.  Still, there is no fundamental reason why life might not arise far from any star, in what is often regarded as the barren desert of interstellar space. Here is how it might happen.  First, we had better agree on what counts as \"life\". It does not necessarily have to look like anything familiar.  > The broad basis of life on Earth \u2013 that it is carbon-based and requires water \u2013 \"reflects a universal norm\"  As an extreme case, we can imagine something like the Black Cloud in astronomer Fred Hoyle's classic 1959 science-fiction novel of that name: a kind of sentient gas that floats around in interstellar space, and is surprised to discover life on a planet.  But Hoyle could not offer a plausible explanation for how a gas, with an unspecified chemical make-up, could become intelligent. We probably need to imagine something literally a bit more solid.  While we cannot be sure that all life is carbon-based, as it is on Earth, there are good reasons to think that it is likely. Carbon is much more versatile as a building block for complex molecules than, say, silicon, the favourite element for speculations about alternative alien biochemistries.  Astrobiologist Charles Cockell at the University of Edinburgh in the UK thinks that the broad basis of life on Earth \u2013 that it is carbon-based and requires water \u2013 \"reflects a universal norm\". He concedes that \"I have a quite conservative view, which science generally proves is misguided.\" But still, for now let's stick with carbon-based life. How could it be generated in outer space?  The basic chemistry is not a problem. As well as sugars, life on Earth needed amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. But we know that these can be formed in outer space too, because they have been found in \"primitive\" meteorites that have never seen a planetary surface.  > Some chemicals could react even when chilled to just four degrees above absolute zero  They might be made on icy grains from some variation of a chemical reaction called the Strecker synthesis, after the 19th-Century German chemist who discovered it. The reaction involves simple organic molecules called ketones or aldehydes, which combine with hydrogen cyanide and ammonia. Alternatively, light-driven chemistry triggered by ultraviolet light will do the job.  It looks at first as though these reactions should not take place in deepest space, without a source of heat or light to drive them. Molecules encountering one another in frigid, dark conditions do not have enough energy to get a chemical reaction started. It is as if they run into a barrier that is too high for them to jump over.  However, in the 1970s the Soviet chemist Vitali Goldanski showed otherwise. Some chemicals could react even when chilled to just four degrees above absolute zero, which is about as cold as space gets. They just needed a bit of help from high-energy radiation such as gamma-rays or electron beams \u2013 like the cosmic rays that whizz through all of space.  Under these conditions, Goldanski found that the carbon-based molecule formaldehyde, which is common in molecular clouds, could link up into polymer chains several hundred molecules long.  Goldanski believed that such space-based reactions might have helped the molecular building blocks of life assemble from simple ingredients like hydrogen cyanide, ammonia and water.  > Generally I think these environments aren't very conducive to very complex molecules  But it is far more difficult to coax such molecules to combine into more complex forms. The high-energy radiation that might help get the first reactions started then becomes a problem.  Ultraviolet and other forms of radiation can induce reactions like those Meinert demonstrated. But Cockell says they are just as likely to smash molecules as they are to form them. Potential biomolecules \u2013 progenitors of proteins and RNA, say \u2013 would be broken apart faster than they were being produced.  \"Ultimately the question is whether other completely alien environments would give rise to self-replicating chemical systems that can evolve,\" says Cockell. \"I don't see why that wouldn't happen in very cold environments or on the surfaces of ice grains, but generally I think these environments aren't very conducive to very complex molecules.\"  Planets offer two much gentler energy sources: heat and light. Life on Earth is largely powered by sunlight, and it is a fair bet that life on \"exoplanets\" around other stars would draw on the energy reserves of their own suns.  > Galaxies might be full of \"rogue planets\" floating beyond the outermost reaches of a stellar neighbourhood  Vital heat can also come from elsewhere. Some scientists believe that the first life on Earth was not powered by sunlight, but by volcanic energy released from the planet's interior at hot vents in the deep sea. Even today, these vents still spew out a warm, mineral-rich brew.  There is also heat in Jupiter's major moons. This comes from the huge tidal forces exerted by the giant planet, which squeeze the interiors of the moons and heat them up through friction. This tidal energy keeps the sub-surfaces of the icy moons Europa and Ganymede melted into oceans, and makes Io's surface fiery and volcanic.  It is hard to see how molecules clinging to icy grains in interstellar space could find any such nurturing energy. But that might not be the only option out there.  In 1999, planetary scientist David Stevenson of the California Institute of Technology proposed that galaxies might be full of \"rogue planets\" floating beyond the outermost reaches of a stellar neighbourhood, too far from their \"parent\" star to feel its gravity, heat or light.  > These rogue planets might be \"the most common sites of life in the Universe\"  These worlds, Stevenson said, could have formed like any other regular planet, close to a nascent star and within its surrounding nebula of gas and dust.  But then the gravitational tug of large planets, like our own Jupiter and Saturn, could sling some planets on \"escape trajectories\", propelling them off beyond their solar system into the empty space between stars.  That might seem to consign them to a cold and barren future. Yet Stevenson argued that, on the contrary, these rogue planets might be \"the most common sites of life in the Universe\" \u2013 because they might stay warm enough to support liquid water under, as it were, their own steam.  All of the rocky planets in the inner solar system come with two internal heat sources.  First, each planet has a fiery core still hot from the primordial fury of its formation. On top of that, they contain radioactive elements. These warm up the interior of the planet with their decay, just as a lump of uranium is warm to the touch. On Earth, radioactive decay inside the mantle contributes about half of the total heating.  > Rogue planets would not be plagued by giant meteorite impacts  Primordial heat and radioactive decay inside rocky rogue planets could warm them for billions of years \u2013 perhaps enough to keep the planets volcanically active and provide the energy for life to start.  Rogue planets could also have dense, heat-retaining atmospheres. Compared with gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, Earth's atmosphere is thin and tenuous, because the Sun's heat and light have stripped away lighter gases like hydrogen. Mercury is so close to the Sun that it barely has any atmosphere at all.  Yet on an Earth-sized rogue planet, far beyond its parent star's influence, much of the original atmosphere might remain in place. Stevenson estimated that the resulting temperature and pressure could be enough to sustain liquid water at the surface, even without any sunlight.  What's more, rogue planets would not be plagued by giant meteorite impacts, as Earth has been. They might even be ejected from their native solar system with moons in tow, giving them the benefit of some heating by tidal forces.  Even if a rogue planet did not have a thick atmosphere, it could still be habitable.  > Any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe  In 2011, planetary scientist Dorian Abbot and astrophysicist Eric Switzer at the University of Chicago calculated that planets about three and a half times the size of the Earth could become covered over with a thick layer of ice. This would insulate an ocean of liquid water many kilometres below the surface, heated by its interior.  \"The total biological activity would be lower than on a planet like Earth, but you should still be able to have something,\" says Abbot.  He hopes that when space probes investigate the subsurface oceans of Jupiter's icy moons in the coming decades, we will learn more about the possibilities of life on iced-over rogue planets.  Abbot and Switzer called these orphaned worlds \"Steppenwolf planets\", because, they say, \"any life in this strange habitat would exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe\". The habitable lifetime of such a planet could be up to ten billion years or so, similar to that of Earth, says Abbot.  If these ideas are right, then outside our solar system rogue planets in interstellar space could be the closest places where extraterrestrial life exists.  > Imagine bathing in warm volcanic springs under perpetual night, like a winter vacation in Iceland  They would be very hard to spot at such a distance, being dark and relatively tiny.  But with luck, say Abbot and Switzer, such a planet passing within about a thousand times the Earth-Sun distance could just about be discerned from the small amount of sunlight it would reflect and the infrared radiation of its own warmth. We might hope to see it with the telescopes currently used to look for exoplanets around other stars.  If life can originate and survive on an interstellar Steppenwolf planet, say Abbot and Switzer, there is a profound implication: life \"must be truly ubiquitous in the Universe\".  It would be a strange kind of life on these interstellar worlds. Imagine bathing in warm volcanic springs under perpetual night, like a winter vacation in Iceland. But if that is all you had ever known, it would seem like home.  _Follow BBC Earth on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Nobody has ever found a real live dragon, and there are no fossils of them, so it is reasonable to say that they do not exist and never have.  But could they have? Are dragons as we understand them genuinely impossible, or is it simply that evolution has not, yet, thrown them up?  Let's imagine what it would be like if dragons really did exist. Not creatures that just look a bit like dragons, but actual flying dragons that breathe fire. How would such animals have evolved? What would their place be in an ecosystem?  Our ancestors had no need to employ high-tech computer wizardry to create convincing dragons.  \"Most peoples at some point in their history have believed that the dragon was real,\" writes anthropologist David E. Jones in the introduction to his book _An Instinct for Dragons_. In its pages, Jones asks why myths about dragons are so ubiquitous, citing examples from places as diverse as Hawai'i, Iceland and New Zealand.  > When imagining dragons, people have always taken their cue from reality  His answer involves monkeys. On the African savannah, troops of vervet monkeys face three kinds of predator \u2013 snakes, eagles and big cats \u2013 each of which is recognised with a specific alarm call. This alarm-calling behaviour has been extensively studied and used to understand analogous behaviours in humans.  Jones suggests that the dragon is an amalgam of these basic primate fears. The sinuous scaliness of the snake, the wings of the eagle, and the jaws and claws of a big cat combine to form a fearsome memory in an ancient part of our brains.  It is a neat idea, albeit one that is virtually impossible to test.  What certainly is true is that, when imagining dragons, people have always taken their cue from reality. The ancient Chinese philosopher Wang Fu even echoed Jones' theory when he described dragons as possessing the necks of snakes, the claws of eagles and the soles of tigers.  But to find something that looks more like dragons as we imagine them, we need to look at animals from the distant past.  Whatever culture they appear in, dragons are always reptilian. That means the Mesozoic Era is the place to start. It lasted from 252 million years ago until 66 million years ago, and is known as the \"Age of Reptiles\". The most famous Mesozoic reptiles are of course the dinosaurs.  > Any real-life dragons would have filled a similar niche to that occupied by apex predators like Tyrannosaurus rex  The similarities between dinosaurs and dragons are well documented. There is a long history in China of identifying fossilised dinosaur bones as those of dragons.  Palaeontologists have also playfully nodded to dragons when naming their new discoveries. In the dinosaur pantheon we have everything from the \"dragon king of Hogwarts\" (_Dracorex hogwartsia_, a spiky-headed pachycephalosaur) to the \"dragon of Qijiang\" (_Qijianglong guokr_, a 50-foot long sauropod).  Based on their appearance, as well as their taste for large prey like knights and fair maidens, any real-life dragons would have filled a similar niche to that occupied by apex predators like _Tyrannosaurus rex_.  However, a closer look at dragon anatomy suggests it would be wrong to group them with such creatures taxonomically. Instead, the two distinct dragon body forms hint at two alternative evolutionary scenarios.  The first group of dragons contains the _l\u00f3ng_ of China, the _drakon_ of Ancient Greece and the Old English _wyrm_. These are all dragons with elongated bodies and small legs, or no legs at all. In appearance these creatures are essentially snakes, so we should look at the snake family tree.  > Among animals with backbones, wings have evolved three separate times: in birds, bats and pterosaurs  There is fossil evidence to suggest that the first snakes evolved from burrowing lizards, whose legs shrank and eventually disappeared as they adapted to an underground lifestyle. This fits with many classic depictions of subterranean dragons, such as the Nidhogg of Norse legend or the Greek \"earth- dragon\" Python, which gave its name to the real-life genus of large, constricting snakes.  What sets these creatures apart from your average snake is their size. However, that is not a major problem: we only need to look at the fossil record to find some truly dragon-sized snakes.  At 40ft (12m) long, with a body as thick as a man's waist, the mighty _Titanoboa_ was a true monster. It could easily have been the ancestor of a lineage of gigantic, serpentine dragons.  But when you think \"dragon\", chances are you are not thinking of a giant snake. You are imagining the other type of dragon: a creature with large, leathery wings bursting from its shoulders. In short, you are imagining a creature that \u2013 from an anatomical perspective \u2013 should not exist.  Among animals with backbones, wings have evolved three separate times: in birds, bats and pterosaurs. Each time they evolved in roughly the same way: non-flying ancestors gradually transformed their forelimbs into membranous wings supported by modified fingers.  > The giant azhdarchid pterosaurs were perhaps the largest animals ever to take flight  This means that, for a vertebrate, having wings is a trade-off. You can have arms or wings, but not both.  Body plans are highly conserved, so while it is not impossible to imagine a six-limbed vertebrate, the evolutionary leap required is huge. When extra limbs do occur, they tend not to be adaptive. Instead, they are the result of birth defects or, in the case of some unfortunate frogs, parasitic infections.  Perhaps this is why in so many modern fantasy films, from _Harry Potter_ to _The Hobbit_, the classic six-limbed dragon has been ditched in favour of a sleeker four-limbed model. Such a creature is more accurately called a \"wyvern\", and it is at least anatomically more realistic.  There is still the not-insignificant problem of how to get these enormous creatures off the ground. Fortunately for dragons, another group of prehistoric reptiles give their ambitions for flight some hope.  Named after a dragon from Uzbek folk culture, the giant azhdarchid pterosaurs were perhaps the largest animals ever to take flight, and the group most likely to give rise to real-life dragons.  > When birds fly, they get 90% of their launch power from their back legs  An image by palaeoartist and pterosaur researcher Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth in the UK makes this clear. It shows one species of azhdarchid, _Arambourgiania philadelphiae_,\u00a0standing as tall as a giraffe. The largest azhdarchids had wingspans of around 36ft (11m).  These enormous animals could fly, but doing so required a set of specific adaptations. These included a hollow skeleton, to minimise weight, and sturdy upper arm bones on which to anchor massive flight muscles.  Our hypothetical dragons would need the same adaptations. They would also have to make certain anatomical sacrifices.  \"When birds fly, they get 90% of their launch power from their back legs, and then they transfer over to their wings,\" says Witton. \"That means they need to have much bigger bodies, because they need to have two big sets of muscles to get into the air.\"  > Reptiles can master many problems that mammals can  Pterosaurs, on the other hand, relied on their already considerable front- limb/wing strength to launch themselves into the sky. \"They don't need to worry about carrying all their leg muscles into the air with them after they've taken off,\" says Witton. \"That of course means that they can get much bigger.\"  In other words, the largest pterosaurs only got that big by having relatively small torsos and legs. \"Birds get to about 80kg [176lb] and that's as heavy as they can ever get and still fly, whereas a [flying] pterosaur can get to four times that weight,\" says Witton.  Our dragons would have to make the same trade-off. It does not diminish them too much, but it does confine the more bulky, lumbering depictions of them to the scrapheap.  So let's suppose that our proposed dragons were an offshoot of the giant azhdarchid pterosaurs, or another similar group of flying reptiles that evolved in parallel. How feasible are some of their other, more magical attributes?  Mythological dragons are often highly intelligent. This can manifest in a kind of malevolent cunning that they use to outwit potential dragon-slayers, or \u2013 in the case of Eastern dragons \u2013 immense wisdom that is shared with only the most fortunate humans. Either way, dragons possess cognitive abilities that we do not usually associate with reptiles.  Historically, scientists have used the term \"reptilian\" to describe the parts of the human brain associated with basic functions such as breathing. Reptiles themselves have often been described in such terms \u2013 that is, driven by instinct and not intellect. However, in recent years scientists have begun exploring reptile intelligence in a more considered way, designing reptile- specific tasks that properly test their intellectual limits.  > While actual immortality is unlikely, reptiles like giant tortoises and tuataras can clock up well over a century  Their conclusion? \"Reptiles can master many problems that mammals can,\" says Gordon Burghardt of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. \"Complex problem-solving, reversal learning, social learning, complex sociality, tool use and individual recognition have all been discovered.\"  Some of the more intelligent reptiles are the larger species with correspondingly large brains, such as crocodiles and monitor lizards. Another potential contributor to intelligence is longevity, which has also been associated with bigger brains. Dragons are certainly not lacking in size, but what about lifespan?  Many dragons of legend are eternal, ageless creatures, whose lives can only be ended at the hands of a burly hero with a big sword. While actual immortality is unlikely, reptiles like giant tortoises and tuataras can clock up well over a century. The key to such extended lives could be a slow pace and a correspondingly slow metabolism.  That would explain why dragons spend so much of their time lounging around on piles of gold. Speaking of which, could such gold-lust ever evolve?  Given people's enthusiasm for gold and their willingness to fight for it, at first glance it seems that a taste for shiny metal objects would be a distinct disadvantage for even the most well-armoured dragon.  However, some animals do have a thing for bright objects. Many readers will immediately think of magpies, but in fact studies suggest that magpies' supposed love for shiny things is just a superstition.  > A dragon's hoard could be an elaboration of the bowerbird system, with female dragons choosing males with the biggest stack of gold  Bowerbirds are a different matter. To attract females, male bowerbirds line the floors of their \"bowers\" with all sorts of treasures, albeit humbler ones than those found in a dragon's lair. Instead of jewels and coins, bowerbirds hoard berries and pieces of broken glass.  These bizarre birds have been key players in the study of \"sexual selection\": the idea that certain traits evolve because one sex prefers certain characteristics in the other.  Female bowerbirds choose males with high-quality bowers because such bowers are an indicator of quality. If a male has the energy to seek out and arrange the best possible bits of glass, he probably has good-quality genes that will ultimately be passed on to his children. The system works rather well. A dragon's hoard could be an elaboration of the bowerbird system, with female dragons choosing males with the biggest stack of gold.  Our dragons are shaping up nicely. So far we have prehistoric reptiles, maybe a sister group to the giant pterosaurs or giant snakes, with advanced cognitive abilities to match their size and longevity, and a complex mating system based on the procurement of shiny, metallic objects.  This may not sound too far-fetched. But of course we have missed out dragons' most fantastical ability: fire-breathing.  Spitting cobras can fire venomous projectiles from their fangs. The sting of a bullet ant has been described as \"like walking over flaming charcoal with a three inch nail embedded in your heel.\" A bite from a Komodo dragon will leave a wound slathered with toxic proteins. There is no denying that nature has come up with all sorts of horrifying ways for animals to hurt each other, but a flaming discharge is not one of them.  The only things that come close are rather unassuming-looking creatures called bombardier beetles. These insects store hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide in their abdomens. When provoked, they initiate a violent chemical reaction that ejects a near-boiling-hot stream of chemicals at the unfortunate attacker.  Imagine an evolutionary convergence that bestows analogous chemical weaponry on an enormous reptile. Two glands in this creature's neck secrete the necessary solution, and when they mix in the back of its throat, a jet of gas and scalding liquid is expelled from its mouth.  Such a creature is highly implausible, of course, but then so are bombardier beetles.  > They initiate a violent chemical reaction that ejects a near-boiling-hot stream of chemicals at the unfortunate attacker  These beetles have even been cited by creationists as evidence that the theory of evolution cannot be true, on the grounds that they could not have evolved naturally. These anti-evolution arguments have been firmly refuted by scientists, who have outlined the key steps in the transition from non- explosive to explosive beetles.  It is understandable that people are incredulous about these remarkable animals, but as the old adage goes, \"truth is stranger than fiction\". Evolution has yielded some remarkable innovations over the eons.  Dragons may only exist in the human imagination, but the real world can more than match them for strangeness.  _Join over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram._  _If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

It might sound like a beast from a fantasy novel or horror film, but in fact it\u2019s a creature that actually existed - the scariest bird you can imagine, scaled up to nightmarish proportions. Say hello to the terror bird.  After a meteor wiped out _Velociraptor_ and _Tyrannosaurus rex_, the terror bird family rose to occupy the niche of terrifying top predator in South America \u2013 a supremacy that lasted for almost 60 million years. During that time, 17 species in this family of lethal-beaked meatheads came and went, all the while gorging on a smorgasbord of plant-eating mammals until these scary birds disappeared about 2.5 million years ago.  With few fossils documenting their existence, the behaviour of these birds is still somewhat of a mystery. What exactly did these feathered aggressors get up to, and why did they disappear? It\u2019s a story that paleontologists have been painstakingly unearthing for over 100 years. What they\u2019ve learned so far suggests the birds were absolutely dominant as predators, voraciously gobbling up prey across the continent.  **_The second coming_**  Sixty million years ago the continents had largely assumed the geographic position they occupy now, though what we now know as Central America had not yet been created. South America was an island, and while saber-toothed cats and wolves took over the job of top predators elsewhere, most mammals in South America were happy herbivores. This buffet of lumbering vegetarians provided the fresh flesh that terror birds feasted on.  All birds are considered dinosaurs \u2013 most being closely related to meat-eating dinosaurs such as the velociraptor that disappeared 65 million years ago. In a way, the reign of the dinosaur never truly ended in South America, it merely changed form.  > Its beak was designed to make powerful up and down movements  Dr Luis Chiappe, Director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Los Angelos Museum of Natural History, agrees. \u201cNature continues to fill the gaps as animals evolve, and the world evolves,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to think of the terror birds as the dinosaurs of the Cenozoic era in South America.\u201d On that continent, he says, there were no animals that could rival these birds at the top of the food chain.  So how did they do it? What exactly made these terror birds so terrifying?  **_Death by terror bird_**  Terror comes in many forms, something one learns quickly when trying to understand how terror birds, hunted, killed and eviscerated their prey. It\u2019s really not the kind of research to be done before bedtime - there are apparently several options available to an animal equipped with a pickax for a beak.  It\u2019s generally agreed that terror birds were seriously carnivorous, but there\u2019s long been debate over how they killed prey, says Dr Stephen Wroe, Director of the Function, Evolution &amp; Anatomy Research (FEAR) Lab at the University of New England, Australia. Based on CT scans of fossils from the terror bird known as _Andalgalornis__ \\- _an agile, swift-moving bird that lived between 23 and 5 million years ago - Wroe and colleagues were able to narrow down the type of movements this animal was capable of.  Their work suggests that its beak was designed to make powerful up and down movements (think stabbing prey in the head or back from a height), but was relatively weak when moving side to side. The ability to give a rapid side-to- side shaking is what you would expect of an animal that is getting up close and personal with relatively large, dangerous prey, says Wroe, adding that wrestling with large prey is risky. So it\u2019s unlikely _Andalgalornis_ killed this way.  > As if rock hard skulls, deadly beaks, and the use of creepy low sounds to ferret out prey weren\u2019t scary enough, we still haven\u2019t talked about their feet  \u201cIf it was using its beak as the primary killing mechanism, then it would have been restricted to relatively small prey,\u201d says Wroe. However, he\u2019s quick to add that the beak was certainly strong enough to have enabled the bird to bring down larger prey in a sort of strike, retreat and repeat type of hunting, and hasn\u2019t ruled out big animal take-downs just yet.  This year, a new medium-sized species of terror bird, _Llallawavis scagliai, _was identified, providing more clues about the behaviour of this group of birds, and the diversity of the terror bird family tree. Like other terror birds, the joints between skull bones are fused, unlike other birds in which they are more mobile. This rigidity would have been helpful with pummeling prey to death or using their head as a giant meat tenderiser. It would also provide the stable structure needed to rip flesh from bone.  Another intriguing revelation of the study was the analysis of the inner ear canals, reconstructed through 3D imaging. Imaging results suggest the bird may have had good low frequency hearing, possibly to communicate vocally with other terror birds, or in prey detection.  As if rock hard skulls, deadly beaks, and the use of creepy low sounds to ferret out prey weren\u2019t scary enough, we still haven\u2019t talked about their feet.  > Terror birds were the pinnacle of South America\u2019s food chain for tens of millions of years  Wroe points out that many living birds of prey use their feet to kill. Take for example the secretary bird, an avian predator that he says \u201cbasically kicks the crap\u201d out of snakes and reptiles with devastating force. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible certain terror birds may have used that form of attack as well,\u201d he says.  Other clues may be found in the grand-slam feeding style of the terror birds\u2019 closest living relatives, the seriemas. Seriemas pick up snakes, frogs and other prey, then smash them on the ground, or throw them against hard surfaces repeatedly. Though they look like an animal that needs a course in anger management, the technique is actually very effective in breaking the bones and tendersing the meat of their prey.  While sorting all of this out, it\u2019s important to consider that terror bird species came in a variety of shapes and sizes. They ranged in height from one to three metres, with body types that ranged from sleek and light to heavier and stalky. It\u2019s likely the feeding strategies varied between species depending on their size and build, and how fast the animal was able to move.  > It\u2019s big, as fast as an ostrich, with feet that could snap the femur of a cow  \u201cWhen looking at the foot bones, these animals clearly had very different styles of locomotion,\u201d says Chiappe. Some of the lower leg bones were very long, suggesting the species was very fast, versus others with shorter lower leg bones that indicate a \u201cheavier, slower animal \u2013 more of a walker,\u201d he says.  For example, the 350\u2013400\u00a0kg terror bird _Brontornis,_ may have been a slower moving ambush predator. Conversely, the lighter and more agile _Phosphoracus _may have been able to run prey down.  However they did it, one thing is certain: terror birds were the pinnacle of South America\u2019s food chain for tens of millions of years\u2026 until everything changed.  Twelve to 15 million years ago, what we now know as Central America was created through a combination of tectonic up-thrusting and volcanic activity. This new land bridge connected North and South America, and animals slowly began to migrate across it in both directions - a phenomenon known as the Great American Interchange. This exchange of species between hemispheres changed the game for terror birds forever.  **_Terror comes to North America_**  Imagine you are a khaki-clad researcher huddled in a blind on the savannah of what is now Panama. Time means nothing to you - millions of years are only mere moments, as you sit quietly and record the biggest continental exchange of animals the Americas has ever seen.  > Titanis was getting larger and larger so that it could not only compete, but open up some of these carcasses  From the north come ancient camels, massive elephants, tapirs, deer and horses, followed by ravenous cougars, saber-toothed cats, wolves and bears. From the south lumber the glyptodons, giant ground sloths, and bizarre-looking hoofed mammals that looked like a cross between a horse and an anteater. You\u2019re writing this down on a pad of paper when suddenly, the shadow of a three metre high, 150-kilogram bird falls over you.  Meet _Titanis_, evolution\u2019s latest, and last, of the terror birds. It\u2019s big, as fast as an ostrich, with feet that could snap the femur of a cow. A swift peck from this bird will knock your head off. So don\u2019t move, and good luck.  \u201c_Titanis_ is one of the species that over about seven million years makes it from South America all the way up into North America,\u201d says Dr Robert Chandler of Georgia College in Milledgeville, US. Chandler found fossils from _Titanis_ while scuba diving in the Santa Fe River in Florida. It\u2019s likely this monstrous bird was following the northern migration of the prey it was eating, he says.  > Changing habitats and habitat loss that may have sealed the terror birds\u2019 fate  For _Titanis_, life in North America may have been more complicated than back home in the south. Once relatively unchallenged by competitors, now encounters with fanged cats and packs of wolves were cramping its style. It\u2019s all well and good to kill a sloth, but what if a pack of wolves want a piece of the meat?  Chandler believes the big birds found ways to adapt. \u201cIt seems like _Titanis_ was getting larger and larger so that it could not only compete, but open up some of these carcasses,\u201d he says, pointing to similarities in beak structure with modern day vultures. It may even have taken carcasses from other predators, he suggests.  Not everyone agrees. Some of Chandler\u2019s colleagues maintain that the beak was primarily an offensive weapon for taking prey down. Regardless of whether _Titanis_ was thriving or just surviving, its reign of terror came to an end about 2.5 million years ago. Then, the terror bird disappears altogether from the fossil record.  **_And then there were none_**  \u201cThere is almost always more than one thing going wrong for a species to go extinct,\u201d says Wroe. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda like a plane crash. When a plane goes down, there\u2019s almost always a series of events that add up to take it out.\u201d  > Paleontological detectives remain in awe of these enigmatic birds, calling them serious, kickass, terrestrial predators  Early theories suggested that competition with predatory mammals led to the demise of the terror birds. But most scientists think there\u2019s more to it.  Terror birds arrived in North America and were successfully competing, says Chandler. \u201cThey lived for almost seven million years along with all these placental mammals, and then what happens? Well, we have climate change.\u201d  With a changing climate came changing habitats, and habitat loss that may have sealed the terror birds\u2019 fate, explains Chandler. Along with them came the extinction of a massive lion, large horse, and some species of elephants and mastadons.  \u201cIn past extinctions, almost always some sort of climate change plays a role,\u201d Wroe says. But he still feels the problems climate change created were likely exacerbated by the pressures on terror birds created by the mixing of animals from North and South.  As scientists piece together the mystery of this ferocious feathery beast, it\u2019s hoped that further clues about terror bird lifestyle, as well as more fossil bits and pieces, will continue to emerge. In the meantime, paleontological detectives such as Wroe remain in awe of these enigmatic birds, calling them \u201cserious, kickass, terrestrial predators.\u201d  Now that\u2019s something everyone can agree on.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The reign of the terror birds", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150727-the-reign-of-the-terror-birds", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "Panama", "Australia", "French Southern Territories", "United States", "Puerto Rico", "Argentina", "Canada", "Uruguay"], "author": "Niki Wilson"},{"newsText": "A tiny nearby galaxy seems to have formed in a merger, when two even smaller galaxies collided. It is the smallest such \"compound\" galaxy ever found.  The finding hints that the universe's first ever galaxies must have been really rather small. What's more, the tiny merged galaxy offers clues to an even deeper mystery: the nature of dark matter, the invisible stuff that seems to make up most of the material in the universe.  There is lots of evidence that large galaxies grow through repeated mergers \u2013 witness the fiery smashup between the two Antennae galaxies (pictured above), which boast a combined mass of billions of suns. But that evidence dries up for galaxies weighing less than about a billion suns. \"They are difficult to observe because the objects are very faint,\" says Ewa Lokas of the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center in Warsaw, Poland.  Earlier this year, though, a team led by Nicola Amorisco at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark was able to tease out signs of a past merger in a nearby galaxy whose stars weigh a total of just 10 million suns.  The little galaxy is one of three dozen or so that orbit the Milky Way's nearest large neighbour, Andromeda (above). Known as Andromeda II, it has been on astronomers' radar since 2012.  That's when another group noticed that its stars did not move in the expected way. \"It's rotating like a cigar, around its longest axis,\" says Amorisco. \"That is very strange.\"  **A galaxy cobbled together**  So his team combed through the earlier observations again and found what appeared to be a stream of stars all moving in sync within Andromeda II. \"This is essentially what you would find if you had a smaller galaxy destructing within a larger one,\" he says.  > Signs of mergers can disappear very quickly  Amorisco thinks the merger happened when two small galaxies fell into orbit around the much larger Andromeda galaxy.  The merger probably took place within the past 3 billion years, since over longer periods the gravity of the galaxy's other inhabitants should scramble such coherent stellar flows. \"It was a very lucky finding \u2013 signs of mergers can disappear very quickly,\" Amorisco says.  Lokas and her colleagues have now come up with a scenario that can explain the details of the merger. They ran computer simulations and found that a head-on collision between two small disc galaxies can produce a merged galaxy that rotates like a cigar, where the cigar points along the axis of the collision (see images below). \"We are able to reproduce this structure along the long axis,\" says Lokas. Her study will be printed next month in _Monthly Notices Letters of the Royal Astronomical Society_.  The merger explanation for Andromeda II's stellar motions is \"pretty convincing\", says Christopher Conselice of the University of Nottingham in the UK, who was not involved in either study.  > The first galaxies are thought to have formed within nests of dark matter  Conselice says there is a hidden benefit from finding out the size of the smallest galaxies to form directly from collapsing gas, rather than from mergers. It would shed light on dark matter.  The first galaxies are thought to have formed within nests made of dark matter particles, whose speeds should have affected the size of the resulting galaxies. If dark matter is fast-moving, \"the first things to form would be very large\", says Conselice. Sluggish, or \"cold\", dark matter particles, the favoured explanation, would instead have seeded small galaxies.  The timing of the mergers that followed should also be set by dark matter, says Amorisco. Heavier dark matter particles should have quickly drawn in gas to produce the first galaxies, leading to more mergers earlier on in the universe's history. Lighter dark matter particles would have taken longer to form galaxies, leading to fewer \u2013 and later \u2013 mergers.  Andromeda II is the only galaxy in its size range known to have merged, so it is too early to pin down a likely mass for the dark matter this way, Amorisco says. But his team is looking for evidence of mergers in other nearby dwarf galaxies.  Our own Milky Way is orbited by 20-odd dwarf galaxies, as well as the entrails of galaxies its gravity has already torn apart. Worryingly, its merging days are not all behind it.  In about four billion years, the Milky Way will slam into Andromeda, likely tossing our solar system out of its current seat relatively close to the galactic centre.  But Amorisco says we have nothing to fear from the coming crash. \"The sun will destroy us much earlier than Andromeda,\" he says cheerfully.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Little galaxy was born of two colliding galaxies", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141030-dwarf-galaxy-formed-in-collision", "countriesMentioned": ["Denmark", "Poland", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "author": "Maggie McKee"},{"newsText": "Usually there's not much to see on Uranus, says astronomer Imke de Pater of the University of California, Berkeley. But last year was its stormiest on record.  Ever since its equinox in 2007, when the Sun shined directly on its equator, the seventh planet has been becoming more active. Last year it hit a new peak.  When analysing infrared images of Uranus, Prof de Pater's team noticed eight large swirling storms in its northern hemisphere in August 2014.\u00a0One of these storms was the brightest ever observed. It reflected 30% as much light as the rest of the planet, the team reports in the journal _Icarus_.  Nobody had expected it, says de Pater. It shows how little we understand even about planets inside our own Solar System.  The team analysed bright patches on images of Uranus. These spots of light represent clouds.  They deduced how thick the clouds were, and how high up in the atmosphere. From the altitude they could then infer what the clouds were made of.  The clouds they saw were extremely high up. As they rose ever higher, methane gas condensed into methane ice, causing the clouds to glow.  \"The very bright one we saw high in the atmosphere must be methane ice,\" says de Pater. \"Another one observed by amateur astronomers could be hydrogen sulfide.\"  Uranus takes 84 Earth years to travel around the Sun. For half this time one of its poles is in darkness. But during the 2007 equinox each pole was equally lit up, and astronomers expected that this change in illumination would cause a particularly stormy year.  While they did see some turbulent weather, it was nothing compared to the storms of 2014.  **Mystery squalls**  \"We have no idea why this is happening right now,\" says de Pater.  The storms might be driven by the changing seasons, but to find out we would need to see if they also occur over the southern hemisphere. That will take many more years. \"I don't think I will live enough to see the whole cycle of Uranus,\" she adds.  While we frequently see images from Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has only ever been fleetingly visited by one space craft, Voyager 2. But that was in 1986 and it only observed a \"featureless haze\" of dense clouds.  That's why scientists rely on images taken at the ground-based Keck observatory in Hawaii. Increasingly, they also combine these with images taken by amateur astronomers, as their telescopes are powerful enough to see Uranus.

The desolate field is completely unremarkable, except for one thing.  Below it lies a cave that has remained isolated for 5.5 million years. While our ape-like ancestors were coming down from the trees and evolving into modern humans, the inhabitants of this cave were cut off from the rest of the planet.  Despite a complete absence of light and a poisonous atmosphere, the cave is crawling with life. There are unique spiders, scorpions, woodlice and centipedes, many never before seen by humans, and all of them owe their lives to a strange floating mat of bacteria.  In 1986, workers in communist Romania were testing the ground to see if it was suitable for a power plant, when they stumbled across the Movile Cave. Romanian scientist Cristian Lascu was the first to make the dangerous descent.  > To enter, you must first be lowered by rope 20m down a narrow shaft dug into the ground  Since then the cave has remained sealed by the Romanian authorities. Fewer than 100 people have been allowed inside Movile, a number comparable to those who have been to the Moon.  This is partly because the journey into the cave is extremely hazardous.  To enter, you must first lower yourself by rope 20m down a narrow shaft dug into the ground. The only light is from your helmet, which bounces around the walls as you descend.  You must then climb down through narrow limestone tunnels coated in an ochre clay, in pitch darkness and temperatures of 25 \u00b0C.\u00a0 These paths eventually open out into a central cavern containing a lake.  In 2010, microbiologist Rich Boden, who was then at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK, became roughly the 29th person to see the cave.  > In the lake room, the atmosphere is heavy with harmful gases  \"It's pretty warm, and very humid so it feels warmer than it is, and of course with a boiler suit and helmet on that doesn't help,\" says Boden, who is now at the University of Plymouth in the UK.  \"The pool of warm, sulphidic water stinks of rotting eggs or burnt rubber when you disturb it as hydrogen sulphide is given off.\"  In the lake room, the atmosphere is heavy with harmful gases, principally carbon dioxide as well as the hydrogen sulphide from the water.  > The experience is said to be terrifying \u2013 and that's even if you don't have a problem with creepy-crawlies  What's more, the air is low in oxygen: it contains just 10% oxygen rather than the usual 20%. Without breathing apparatus, you would soon develop a headache. Visitors can only stay down for 5 or 6 hours before their kidneys pack in.  To explore the rest of the cave, you must dive into the lake and navigate narrow underwater passageways, squeezing through tiny gaps in the rock before emerging into airspaces called air bells.  Doing this in complete darkness is the most dangerous part of exploring the cave. You are far from the surface, so getting stuck or losing your way in the maze of tunnels would be lethal. The experience is said to be terrifying \u2013 and that's even if you don't have a problem with creepy-crawlies.  Despite the dark and the dangerous gases, Movile Cave is crawling with life. So far 48 species have been identified, including 33 found nowhere else in the world.  > The animals in Movile Cave seem to be without a source of food  There are all sorts of scuttling and slithering things. Snails and shrimps try to avoid the spiders and waterscorpions. In the air bells, leeches swim across the water and prey on earthworms.  Strangely, the worse the air gets the more animals there are. It's not at all obvious why that should be, or how the animals survive at all.  On the surface, plants use sunlight to extract carbon dioxide from the air and turn it into organic compounds. They can then use these chemicals to grow leaves, roots and bulbs. Animals then feed on these plant tissues.  Without sunlight, the animals in Movile Cave seem to be without a source of food.  In most caves, animals get their food from the water dripping down from the surface. This water can often be seen in the form of stalactites and stalagmites.  However, Movile Cave has a thick layer of clay above it, which is impermeable to water. When Lascu first visited, he could not find any stalactites or stalagmites, or any other sign of water coming from the surface.  > The water in Movile Cave comes from a deep underground reservoir  The mystery deepened when scientists analysed the water in the cave for radioactive caesium and strontium. The 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl had released lots of these metals, which had found their way into the soils and lakes surrounding Movile Cave. However, a 1996 study found no traces of them inside the cave.  That means the water isn't coming from above, so it must be coming from below. It now seems that the water in Movile Cave comes from spongy sandstones where it has lain for 25,000 years.  However, this still doesn't explain how the animals in the cave survive. Tests have shown that the water flowing in does not contain any food particles.  Instead, the food comes from the strange frothy foam sitting on top of the water.  This floating film, which looks like wet tissue paper and can even be torn like paper, contains millions upon millions of bacteria known as \"autotrophs\".  > Sulphuric acid actually erodes the limestone, which is gradually making the cave bigger  \"These bacteria get their carbon from carbon dioxide just like plants do,\" says Boden. \"The carbon dioxide level in the cave is about 100 times higher than normal air. But unlike plants, they obviously can't use photosynthesis as there is no light.\"  Rather than using light as an energy source, the Movile bacteria use a process known as chemosynthesis.  \"They get the energy needed\u2026 from chemical reactions: the key ones being the oxidation of sulphide and similar sulphur ions into sulphuric acid, or the oxidation of ammonium found in the groundwaters to nitrate,\" says Boden.  These chemosynthetic bacteria help explain why the cave is so large and the air is so thick with carbon dioxide.  > Movile is the only cave whose ecosystem is known to be supported in this way  \"Sulphuric acid actually erodes the limestone, which is gradually making the cave bigger,\" says Boden. \"The process releases carbon dioxide, which is why levels are so high.\"  Another major group of bacteria get their energy and carbon from the methane gas that bubbles up through the waters of the cave. They are called methanotrophs.  Boden describes methanotrophs as \"messy eaters\" that \"constantly leak metabolic intermediates like methanol and formate\" into the surrounding water. In turn, these chemicals are food for other species of bacteria.  This may all sound very peculiar, and in some ways it is. Movile is the only cave whose ecosystem is known to be supported in this way, and the only such ecosystem on land.  > The Movile bacteria are very similar to bacteria found elsewhere  But according to microbiologist J. Colin Murrell of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, the bacteria in Movile Cave are remarkably simple and not at all unusual.  \"The bacteria get all of their carbon from just one source, be it methane or carbon dioxide,\" says Murrell. \"That means that all of the components of their cells, be it the DNA in their nucleus, the lipids in their cell membrane and the proteins in their enzymes, are made from the same simple ingredient.\"  The Movile bacteria are also very similar to bacteria found elsewhere, despite having being trapped in the cave for over 5 million years.  \"Methanotrophs are everywhere: the Roman Baths at Bath, the surface of seawater, the mouths of cattle and probably the human mouth and gut,\" says Boden. \"Autotrophic bacteria of the same types we found at Movile are found in almost all soils and on the surface of the skin.\"  The same cannot be said for the animals of the cave. Millions of years of isolation has transformed them.  Many are born without eyes, which would be useless in the dark. Almost all are translucent as they have lost pigment in their skin. Many also have extra-long appendages such as antennae to help them feel their way around in the darkness.  > One of the spiders was closely related to a spider found in the Canary Islands \u2013 which lie over 4000km to the west  There are no flies in Movile Cave, but the spiders still spin webs. Small insects called springtails bounce into the air and get caught in the webs.  In 1996, researchers categorised the animals in the cave. They included 3 species of spider, a centipede, 4 species of isopod (the group that includes woodlice), a leech never seen anywhere else in the world, and an unusual- looking insect called a waterscorpion.  Strangely, one of the spiders was closely related to a spider found in the Canary Islands \u2013 which lie over 4000km to the west, off the north-west coast of Africa.  That raises the question, how and why did the animals get into the cave?  One theory is that back at the end of the Miocene Epoch, about 5.5 million years ago, the climate of the northern hemisphere changed. As Africa moved north it stopped the Atlantic from flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, drying it out.  > It's very likely that the bacteria have been there a lot longer than five million years  This could have forced the animals to seek refuge in the sulphurous underworld of Movile Cave. It would have been a haven, with thermal waters providing constant warmth, no competitors or predators, and a rich source of food.  The problem with this theory is that it is difficult to prove.  \"It's very likely that the bacteria have been there a lot longer than five million years, but that the insects became trapped there around that time,\" says Murrell. \"They could have simply fallen in and become trapped when the limestone cast dropped, sealing the cave until it was discovered again in 1986.\"  It may be that different animals arrived at different times. A 2008 study of Movile's only snail suggested that it has been down there for just over 2 million years. When it entered the cave, the ice age was just beginning, and the snail may have escaped the cold by going underground.  However they got there, it seems that Movile's inhabitants are now trapped for good. We could learn a lot from them.  > It could be that the first living cells were similar to those found in Movile Cave  The bacteria's ability to oxidise methane and carbon dioxide is of particular interest. These two greenhouse gases are the biggest culprits for global warming, so researchers are desperate to find efficient ways to remove them from the atmosphere.  The Movile Cave microbes could also offer hints about how the first life formed on Earth. They are genetically similar to those found in geothermal vents, which are also rich in carbon dioxide, sulphides and ammonia.  The conditions in both places may well be similar to the primordial Earth. In our world's early years, the Sun's light was obscured by an atmosphere thick with carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia. It could be that the first living cells were similar to those found in Movile Cave.  Almost 30 years after its discovery, Movile Cave remains perhaps the most isolated ecosystem on the planet. It surely has many more secrets to give up. There are plenty more organisms buried in the cave's sediments, waiting to be identified, and they could help us understand some of our deepest questions about the nature of life.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The bizarre beasts living in Romania's poison cave", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150904-the-bizarre-beasts-living-in-romanias-poison-cave", "countriesMentioned": ["Romania", "Central African Republic", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Sweden", "Canada", "Australia"], "author": "Jasmin Fox-Skelly"},{"newsText": "About 73,000 years ago, a volcano collapsed into the sea.  Pico do Fogo is located on Fogo island, part of the Cape Verde archipelago off the north-west coast of Africa. As its rocks smashed into the ocean, the impact created a 240m (800ft) tsunami wave that engulfed Santiago island 34 miles away.  The impact would have been catastrophic for anyone living on Santiago. Fortunately, the Cape Verde islands were uninhabited until the mid-1400s.  Pico do Fogo is still active today, with eruptions roughly every 20 years. Collapses like the one 73,000 years ago are extremely rare, but researchers can look to the past to understand the impact of any potential future volcanic collapses.  Geologist Ricardo Ramalho of Bristol University in the UK started working on the Cape Verde islands in 2005. He soon noticed a series of strange boulders on Santiago island.  The more he looked, the more he discovered. Eventually he found more than 40 boulders, some weighing over 700 tonnes.  Strangely, these large rocks were quite different from any other volcanic deposits on the island. Ramalho discovered they were made of the same stuff as the rocks on the island's shoreline, which had been generated by tsunamis.  Since these deposits were situated at sea level, it had been assumed that the tsunami that created them was quite small.  Ramalho's latest study indicates that the tsunami was a big one.  The boulders he analysed are 220m above sea level. That could only mean one thing, he says: the tsunami generated by Pico do Fogo's collapse was powerful enough to push rock deposits all that way inland.  \"Tsunamis are not waves that splash, they are like floods of immense water that can go uphill,\" says Ramalho.  By dating the boulders, Ramalho and his colleagues have figured out when the tsunami occurred, a finding that is now published in the journal _Science Advances_.  > These things are real and can potentially happen again  The team was also able to estimate the size of the wave by calculating the energy needed to drag the boulders over 600m inland, though Ramalho admits it is a \"crude estimate\".  More broadly, the work provides further evidence that large volcanic collapses can trigger mega-tsunamis. It was already clear that collapses could trigger smaller tsunamis, but nobody was sure if bigger waves could be generated.  \"Flank collapses can happen extremely fast and catastrophically, and therefore are capable of triggering giant tsunamis,\" says Ramalho.  \"These things are real and can potentially happen again,\" he says.  \"Because they have a high impact we should be vigilant. We need to start thinking about what we can do to improve resilience to such an event.\"  Mega-tsunamis like this might happen every 10,000 years, says Bill McGuire from University College London in the UK, who was not involved with the study.  \"The scale of such events\u2026 and their potentially devastating impact, makes them a clear and serious hazard in ocean basins that host active volcanoes,\" says McGuire.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The tsunami that engulfed an island ", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151005-the-tsunami-that-engulfed-an-island", "countriesMentioned": ["Central African Republic", "Canada", "Chile", "Peru", "Philippines", "Brazil", "Mexico", "Colombia"], "author": "Melissa Hogenboom"},{"newsText": "Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionThe US space agency says it believes dark stripes on Mars are flows of water.  Scientists think they can now tie dark streaks seen on the surface of Mars to periodic flows of liquid water.  Data from a Nasa satellite shows the features, which appear on slopes, to be associated with salt deposits.  Crucially, such salts could alter the freezing and vaporisation points of water in Mars's sparse air, keeping it in a fluid state long enough to move.  Luju Ojha and colleagues report the findings in the journal Nature Geoscience.  There are implications for the existence of life on the planet today, because any liquid water raises the possibility that microbes could also be present. And for future astronauts on Mars, the identification of water supplies near the surface would make it easier for them to \"live off the land\".  \"It may decrease the cost - and increase the resilience - of human activity on the planet,\" co-author Mary-Beth Willhelm, from the Nasa Ames Research Center in California, said in a US space agency media briefing on Monday.  ## Secret source  Researchers have long wondered whether liquid water might occasionally flow across the surface today.  It is not a simple proposition, because the temperatures are usually well below zero Celsius and the atmospheric pressure is so low that any liquid H2O will rapidly boil.

These streaks, called \"recurring slope lineae\" (RSL), were well known to Mars scientists and were suspected - but not proven - to be associated with trickling water.  \"We know from prior investigations that these features form on Mars,\" Mr Ojha told journalists at the briefing.  \"However, the key evidence was missing until now - and that was their chemical identity.\"  Alfred McEwen, a senior member of the orbiter team and a professor of planetary geology at the University of Arizona, agreed: \"We had no direct detection of water; that was just our best guess as to what these were.\"  Now, Crism has demonstrated that the RSLs are covered with salts.  They are salts - magnesium perchlorate, chlorate and chloride - that can drop the freezing point of water by 80 degrees and its vaporisation rate by a factor of 10.  The combination allows briney water to stay stable long enough to trickle down hillsides and crater walls.  Quite where the water is coming from to make the streaks is still unclear, however. The locations of RSL are mostly equatorial, and any stored water in this region of Mars, perhaps in the form of ice, is thought to exist only at great depth.  One possibility is that the salts actually pull the water out of the atmosphere. The Curiosity rover has found some strong pointers to this mechanism. But again, it is not known whether there is a sufficient supply in the air to facilitate a decent flow.

It is conceivable that streaks are being formed from different sources in different parts of Mars.  ## Contamination question  Dr Joe Michalski is a Mars researcher at the Natural History Museum in London. He called the announcement an exciting development, especially because of its implications for the potential of microbes existing on the planet today.  \"We know from the study of extremophiles on Earth that life can not only survive, but thrive in conditions that are hyper-arid, very saline or otherwise 'extreme' in comparison to what is habitable to a human. In fact, on Earth, wherever we find water, we find life. That is why the discovery of water on Mars over the last 20 years is so exciting.\"  An interesting consequence of the findings is that space agencies will now have some extra thinking to do about where they send future landers and rovers.  Current internationally agreed rules state that missions should be wary of going to places on Mars where there is likely to be liquid water. Spacecraft would need to be thoroughly sterilised beforehand.

It's a shame because the view would be unique. It is the closest planet to the Sun, and so our star would appear three times bigger than it does from Earth. Not that you would appreciate it if you saw it, because you'd be burned to a crisp.  It's scorching on the sunny side of Mercury, reaching 430 \u00b0C during the day. In stark contrast, in the dark craters at its poles night-time temperatures plunge to -180 \u00b0C. These shadowy spots look out into deep space and are locked in a permanent deep-freeze.  In cosmic terms, Mercury is one of our closest neighbours, but it is only in the last 5 years that we have found out very much about it. That's thanks to a NASA probe called Messenger, which spent 4 years studying the planet, finishing in May 2015.  Once thought of as a dull, burnt-out rock, it turns out Mercury is a distinctly odd planet, with a violent history. The latest findings go some way towards explaining why it is so peculiar. In the process, they could also help us understand why our own Earth is the way it is \u2013 and what to expect from planets elsewhere in the galaxy.  Mercury is almost impossible to study from Earth. Although it is visible to the naked eye, it is only visible close to sunrise and sunset, and doesn't rise far over the horizon. For most of human history, it has been nothing more than a moving dot.  > How did it form, and how did it get a magnetic field?  That changed in the 1970s, when the Mariner 10 spacecraft visited the planet. It managed three flybys between 1974 and 1975, but because it had to protect itself from Mercury's intense heat, it only took photos of one side. As a result, we had only seen 45% of the planet's surface.  Mercury, it turned out, looked a lot like our own Moon. It is grey and barren. The surface is covered with craters, evidence of explosive collisions with asteroids and comets.  It has a very thin atmosphere, which explains the sharp temperature differences. The thin air cannot trap much of the Sun's heat, and cannot carry heat from the equator to the poles.  Mariner also found hints that Mercury had once been volcanically active. There was also evidence that it had a magnetic field.  But beyond that, the planet remained an enigma. How did it form, and how did it get a magnetic field \u2013 something most small planets don't have? What has happened to it over its 4.5-billion-year history?  Almost 20 years ago, NASA researchers began developing the Messenger probe, which would get much closer to Mercury and photograph the entire surface. Messenger finally entered Mercury's orbit in 2011.  > Unable to maintain a stable orbit, it crashed into the planet  \"We watched the first image come down, realising we were seeing a bit part of Mercury that had never been seen,\" says Sean Solomon, the mission's principal investigator and now director of the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York.  Messenger was only meant to last one year, but it ended up orbiting for four and sending home over 280,000 images. The mission finally ended in May 2015 when the spacecraft ran out of fuel. Unable to maintain a stable orbit while being buffeted by the Sun's powerful gravity, it crashed into the planet.  The most obvious revelations were about the surface of the planet. It is surely lifeless, but it is still host to some surprising things.  **Surface**  Despite its intense heat, some of the craters at Mercury's poles are filled with water ice. Messenger detected these mysterious dark patches in 2012. They are permanently shadowed from the Sun. The Moon may have something similar.  > Comets could have dumped material on Mercury without actually hitting it  There's more. The water ice deposits at Mercury's poles are covered, in some places, by a mysterious dark material. It is slightly warmer than the ice, 20-30cm thick, and darker than anything else on Mercury.  It may be organic material. That doesn't mean something alive \u2013 Mercury is far too inhospitable for that \u2013 but simply chemicals containing carbon.  Many objects orbiting further from the Sun, such as comets and water-rich asteroids, contain organic material. Some of these may have crashed into Mercury, and left organic deposits behind.  \"If the hypothesis is correct, this substance was delivered to Mercury by the impact of the same objects that brought water ice to Earth,\" says Solomon.  Comets could have dumped material on Mercury without actually hitting it. Other parts of the surface are much darker than our Moon, and a 2015 analysis proposes that passing comets gave off a sprinkling of carbon that has dusted the rocks.**   **  **Origins**  Beyond this, Messenger's images of Mercury's surface rewrote our ideas about its history. Astronomers had thought that it had sat there, more or less inert, for billions of years, getting quietly baked. We now know its past was explosive.  \"The early history of Mercury might have been very volcanic,\" says team member Paul Byrne of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas.  > We expected everything to be over almost four billion years ago  The evidence of past volcanic activity is abundant. There are lines scratched on Mercury's face. These are evidence that the surface has fractured. Messenger also found volcanic vents 25km (15.5m) long where hot lava once flowed, carving long ridges.  This volcanic activity went on until around one billion years ago \u2013 surprisingly recently. \"We expected everything to be over almost four billion years ago,\" says Byrne.  There is even evidence of flood volcanism. Torrents of lava once poured onto Mercury's surface, and make up large swathes of its crust. The biggest such flood happened on its northern polar region, now known as the Northern Volcanic Plain. This great lava plain accounts for 6% of Mercury's surface.  These large flows buried what must have once been large craters, some of which are visible in the image above. Only traces of their rims remain, and these are called \"ghost craters\".  The strange thing is, most of Mercury's plains are about the same age, so they must have formed all at once.  > Mercury has shrunk  \"The last big phase of lava plain formation happened in one go,\" says Byrne. \"This means there was an enormous amount of heat, an enormous amount of magma that came onto the surface.\"  Nowadays Mercury is not volcanically active. That's because the interior heat that powered the volcanic activity has cooled down.  As a result, Mercury has shrunk. Four billion years ago when the crust first solidified the planet was 7km bigger than it is today. Mariner 10's images had suggested this, but Messenger's show that it shrank much more than originally thought.  Despite cooling down, Mercury's interior still has enough energy to give it something hardly any other small planets have: a magnetic field.  **Magnetic field**  Mercury is the only rocky planet, apart from Earth, to have one today \u2013 although its field is 100 times weaker than our own. There's evidence Mars once had one, but as it cooled down the field died.  > We had been assuming that Mercury was a small version of Earth  Earth's is powered by the rotation of its core, a hot ball of liquid metal. Messenger verified that Mercury's field is generated the same way.  But there is something odd. Mercury's is not centred on the planet, but is offset by about 20% of its radius.  This had not been predicted by any previous models, says Solomon. \"We had been assuming that Mercury was a small version of Earth.\"  Instead, Mercury turns out to be something quite different.  In some ways this finding simply highlights our ignorance about magnetic fields. We don't properly understand how planets generate them, and we don't know what Earth's magnetic field was like when the planet was young.  > This ancient magnetic field was much stronger than the modern one  Today Earth's magnetic field is centred, and physicists had assumed that that had always been the case. But maybe it wasn't, says Solomon: maybe Earth once had a magnetic field that looked more like Mercury's.  In 2015 the Messenger team also discovered that Mercury's magnetic field is ancient, having been active almost four billion years ago. Catherine Johnson of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and her colleagues examined magnetised rocks on the planet's surface, which record the history of the magnetic field.  This ancient magnetic field was much stronger than the modern one. It may have been as strong as Earth's field is today. Johnson says the mechanism generating it might have been subtly different in the planet's early days, allowing for a more powerful field.  **Other worlds**  Like our own Earth, Mercury is also about 4.5 billion years old. Yet the two planets are vastly different. Our other neighbours, Venus and Mars, tell other stories entirely.  > Almost 2,000 \"exoplanets\" have been discovered  Astronomers aren't just trying to understand Mercury for its own sake, says Solomon. Doing so will help us understand planets in general.  If we want to figure out how the Earth formed, we need to understand all the processes that created the planets in our solar system. \"In our own solar system alone,\" says Solomon, \"common processes forming Earth-like planets have led to such different outcomes.\"  The same may well be true for planets outside our solar system. Almost 2,000 \"exoplanets\" have been discovered and estimates suggest there could be thousands more. If we can figure out the rules of planet formation, we can make informed guesses about what each exoplanet is like.  For instance, Earth's surface is divided into a mosaic of shifting plates, whereas Mercury is a one-plate planet.  > Mercury could be the archetype for one-plate planets in other solar systems  That's because Earth has more internal energy than Mercury, powering the movement of the plates. As a result Earth still has volcanoes and earthquakes, and is altogether livelier.  If an exoplanet has enough energy to break the plates apart, it is more likely to look a bit like Earth. If it doesn't, it might resemble Mercury.  \"Mercury could be the archetype for one-plate planets in other solar systems, so we can understand their geological history on the basis of what we see in Mercury today,\" says Byrne.  In other words, we are not just studying Mercury. We might actually be studying thousands of planets, most of which we will never see, but whose stories we can figure out by looking at Mercury.

American astronomers say they have strong evidence that there is a ninth planet in our Solar System orbiting far beyond even the dwarf world Pluto.  The team, from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), has no direct observations to confirm its presence just yet.  Rather, the scientists make the claim based on the way other far-flung objects are seen to move.  But if proven, the putative planet would have 10 times the mass of Earth.  The Caltech astronomers have a vague idea where it ought to be on the sky, and their work is sure to fire a campaign to try to track it down.  \"There are many telescopes on the Earth that actually have a chance of being able to find it,\" said Dr Mike Brown.  \"And I'm really hoping that as we announce this, people start a worldwide search to go find this ninth planet.\"  ## Strange swing  The group's calculations suggest the object orbits 20 times farther from the Sun on average than does the eighth - and currently outermost - planet, Neptune, which moves about 4.5 billion km from our star.  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionDr Ellen Stofan, Nasa's chief scientist, says she is \"a bit sceptical\" about a ninth planet  But unlike the near-circular paths traced by the main planets, this novel object would be in a highly elliptical trajectory, taking between 10,000 and 20,000 years to complete one full lap around the Sun.  The Caltech group has analysed the movements of objects in a band of far-off icy material known as the Kuiper Belt. It is in this band that Pluto resides.  The scientists say they see distinct alignments among some members of the Kuiper Belt - and in particular two of its larger members known as Sedna and 2012 VP113. These alignments, they argue, are best explained by the existence of a hitherto unidentified large planet.  \"The most distant objects all swing out in one direction in a very strange way that shouldn't happen, and we realised the only way we could get them to swing in one direction is if there is a massive planet, also very distant in the Solar System, keeping them in place while they all go around the Sun,\" explained Dr Brown.  \"I went from trying very hard to be sceptical that what we were talking about was true, to suddenly thinking, 'this might actually be true'.\"  * * *  ## The 'ninth planet' - where to look?  Image copyright Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC)  The six most distant known objects in the Solar System with orbits exclusively beyond Neptune (magenta) all line up in a single direction. Why? Drs Brown and Batygin argue that this is because a massive planet (orange) is anti-aligned with these objects. Can telescopes now find this planet? Could the evidence already be in observational data but no-one has yet recognised it? The hunt is on.  * * *  The idea that there might be a so-called Planet X moving in the distant reaches of the Solar System has been debated for more than a hundred years. It has fallen in and out of vogue.  What makes this claim a little more interesting is Dr Brown himself.  He specialises in finding far-flung objects, and it was his discovery of 2 ,236km-wide Eris in the Kuiper Belt in 2005 that led famously to the demotion of Pluto from full planet status a year later (Dr Brown's Twitter handle is @PlutoKiller).  At that stage, Pluto was thought to be slightly smaller than Eris, but is now known to be just a little bit bigger.  Others who model the outer Solar System have been saying for some years that the distribution of sizes seen in the objects so far identified in the Kuiper Belt suggests another planet perhaps the size of Earth or Mars could be a possibility. But there is sure to be strong scepticism until a confirmed observation is made.  Nasa's chief scientist, Ellen Stofan, said she certainly needed telescopic evidence.  \"The intriguing point is: we've identified lots of planets (beyond our Solar System) in this category of 'super-Earth' with our Kepler telescope; over 5,000 planet candidates. The fact that we don't have a planet in that size class between Earth and Neptune makes us think, 'well, maybe we are missing one', and maybe they've predicted it,\" she told BBC News.

Ronald Berry, from Hull, was so highly regarded that when the wartime prime minister died in 1965, the fighter ace was one of 14 members of the \"Few\" chosen to march at the head of Churchill's state funeral procession.  He was a Spitfire pilot with the Royal Air Force during what came to be known as the Battle of Britain and flew more than 400 combat missions in World War II.  During the battle, Mr Berry's exploits included shooting down three German Messerschmitt 109s in one day's fighting and he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar.  Winston Churchill coined the famous phrase of the \"Few\", referring to RAF pilots, during a speech in the House of Commons after the Battle of Britain in 1940, when he said \"never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\".  Image caption Ronald Berry was one of the \"Few\" chosen to play a part in the funeral procession  Hull City Council is considering creating a permanent memorial to Mr Berry, possibly with a blue plaque at the place of his birth in Westcott Street.  Mr Berry was born in Hull in 1917 and was only 23 years old when he found himself in the thick of the Battle of Britain flying with 603 Squadron.  He had learned to fly as part of the RAF Volunteer Reserve before the war, said local author Donald Chester, who has written a book about the fighter ace's exploits.  ## Fighting skills  The pilot's home town was heavily bombed by the German air force during the war and the author said Mr Berry \"was the perfect expression of Hull fighting back\".  He said during the Battle of Britain, Mr Berry shot down 10 enemy aircraft, claimed his part in the destruction of another six, had eight \"probables\" and also caused damage to nine.  Mr Chester said he had not initially heard about the local fighter ace but once he discovered him, he was determined to write the full story.  \"I went to get press cuttings and found one from 1941. There was not even a local obituary as far as I could find,\" he added.  Mr Berry's nephew, Peter Long, 77, remembers as a young child seeing the pilot at the family home in Hull during World War II.  \"I used to visit my grandma's even with the Blitz on. We were out in the shelter most nights,\" he said.  During those visits home his uncle \"never used to brag about anything\".  \"He talked a bit about flying but it was the technical side,\" said Mr Long.  Mr Berry's physique helped his combat exploits because he was able to throw his Spitfire around the sky in numerous deadly dogfights, he said.  ## Nuclear deterrent  \"Ron was small and thickset and he said it helped tremendously with the effects of G-force, he could take up more G-force,\" he said.  \"It really did help in the twisting, tight turns of a dogfight. That's why he was never shot down,\" he added.  Mr Berry was promoted to the rank of squadron leader and by 1942 during Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, he was put in charge of a wing of five Spitfire squadrons at the age of 26.  Later he was sent to train new fighter pilots and was a wing commander by the time the war ended in 1945. He was then posted to America on an exchange with the US Air Force.  He also joined Bomber Command to lead a nuclear deterrent squadron of Valiants in the 1950s and by 1959 was working at the Air Ministry and rose to the rank of Air Commodore before retiring in 1969.

It is one of the driest places in the world, and some sections of the Mars-like expanse can go 50 years without feeling a drop of rain. As poet Alonso de Ercilla put it in 1569: \u201cTowards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation.\u201d  Yet Atacama is not devoid of life. Microorganisms called endoliths have found a way to cling on, by hiding themselves inside the pores of rocks, where there\u2019s just enough water to survive. \u201cThey support a whole community of organisms that eat the byproducts of their metabolism,\u201d says Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all just sitting right there in the rocks \u2013 it\u2019s quite fascinating.\u201d  Life, it seems, has an incredible knack for finding ways to persist. Indeed, microorganisms have been around for nearly four billion years, giving them ample time to adapt to some of the most extreme conditions in the natural world. But are there places left on Earth so harsh that they are rendered sterile?  Heat is a good starting point for answering this question. The record for heat tolerance is currently held by a group of organisms called hyperthermophile methanogens, which thrive around the edges of hydrothermal vents in the deep sea. Some of these organisms can grow at temperatures of up to 122C (252F).  Most researchers believe that around 150C (302F) is the theoretical cut-off point for life, however. At that temperature proteins fall apart and chemical reactions cannot occur \u2013 a quirk of the biochemistry that life on Earth (so far as we know) abides by. This means that microorganisms can thrive around hydrothermal vents, but not directly within them, where temperatures can reach up to 464C (867F). The same is true for the interior of an active volcano on land. \u201cI really think temperature is the most hostile parameter,\u201d says Helena Santos, a microbial physiologist at the New University of Lisbon and president of the International Society for Extremophiles. When things get hot enough, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible \u2013 everything is destroyed.\u201d  High pressure, by contrast, appears to be less of a problem for life. This means that heat rather than depth probably limits how far below the surface of the Earth life occurs. The centre of the Earth\u2019s 6,000C (10,800F) temperature certainly precludes all life, although the depth at which the cut-off occurs is still under investigation. One microorganism called _Desulforudis audaxviator_ was discovered nearly two miles (3.2km) below the Earth\u2019s surface, in a South African gold mine. It has not been in contact with the surface for potentially millions of years, and survives by siphoning nutrients from rocks undergoing radioactive decay.  Life exists at the other extreme, too, in subfreezing conditions. Bacteria in the genus _Psychrobacter _can happily live below -10C (14F) in Siberian permafrost and Antarctic glacier mud. Living cells recently turned up in a subglacial lake below the Antarctic ice. And Antarctica\u2019s hypersaline Deep Lake hosts unique salt-loving species, even at -20C (-4F). To survive in these environments, microrganisms possess features such as specially adapted membranes and protein structures, and anti-freeze molecules within their cells. Given that the Earth has been covered in ice multiple times since life first evolved, \u201can ice-covered lake in Antarctica does not seem all that extreme,\u201d says Jill Mikucki, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee.  Radiation typically does not deter microorganisms, either. So long as they are not in the direct pathway of an atomic blast \u2013 which would likely burn them up \u2013 they can thrive in containers of radioactive waste or near the epicentre of the Chernobyl disaster, for example. _Deinococcus radiodurans_, one of the hardiest of the radio-resistant microorganisms, has survived trips into space and can endure radiation doses of up to 15,000 gray (the standard measure of the absorbed dose of radiation). For humans, just 5 gray causes death.  Likewise, what we register as deadly chemical environments, some extremophiles call home sweet home. Various organisms depend on arsenic, mercury or other heavy metals for their growth and survival, while others prefer cyanide. In the hot springs of Kamchatka in Russia, menageries of microorganisms metabolise using sulphur or carbon monoxide. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a chemical that can kill all life,\u201d says Frank Robb, a microbiologist at the University of Maryland.  There might be isolated exceptions, however. Don Juan Pond in Antarctica is the saltiest known body of water on the planet, with salinity levels topping 40%. (The Dead Sea is around 33%). Researchers have recovered traces of microbial life from the pond, but they are still trying to determine whether it is actively growing and replicating there, or just blowing in from other locations. Don Juan counts as \u201can example of a place on the surface of Earth where we might expect life, but cannot verify the presence of active life,\u201d says Corien Bakermans, a microbiologist at Penn State University.  For now, extreme heat and some synthetic laboratory environments might be the only sterile conditions on the planet\u2019s surface that it\u2019s possible to find zero traces of life. New organisms are regularly discovered that push the boundaries of life as we understand it, although where that line will ultimately be drawn remains unknown. As Santos says, \u201cWhat does not exist is more difficult to prove than what does exist.\u201d  Even if there are some lone holdouts of sterility in the natural world, however, the environment exists in a constant state of flux \u2013 and if extremophiles teach us anything, it is that organisms are always capable of adapting. \u201cGive them enough time and they will find a way,\u201d says DiRuggiero.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The last place on Earth without life", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140303-last-place-on-earth-without-life", "countriesMentioned": ["Antarctica", "Russian Federation", "Portugal", "United States", "Australia", "Russia", "France", "Brazil"], "author": "Rachel Nuwer"},{"newsText": "![W Rowland Ding](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/B3E4/production /_96025064_01williamrowlandding-8x6.jpg) Image copyright Julian Ding Image caption William Rowland Ding became a celebrity due to his flying exploits  A pilot killed in a crash a century ago is to be remembered with a ceremony later.

It's something I've been looking forward to for over 20 years, and it looks like I'm not alone.  I was born at the start of the 1980s and became fascinated by astronomy towards the end of the decade. By that time, space probes had visited every planet \u2013 except Pluto.  Now we finally know the simplest thing: what it looks like.  Before we go any further, let me get something out of the way. I am fully aware that Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet, not a \"proper\" planet. I'm not trying to question that. I'm using the word \"planet\" simply because, when I first became fascinated by space, Pluto was classed as a planet, so that's how I thought of it. As a popular page on Facebook puts it, \"When I was your age, Pluto was a planet\".  Until the last week, Pluto has been the one big enigma in the solar system. In my first astronomy books, it was the one \"planet\" that only merited a page or two because there was so little to say.  It was also the only one that wasn't illustrated with big colour photos.  Instead, the images were often no better than the ones astronomer Clyde Tombaugh used to discover Pluto back in 1930.  These two shots were taken six days apart, during which time Pluto gave itself away by moving slightly against the stationary background stars. The arrows show where it is in each photo.  That was about all Tombaugh had to work with, and for decades that was all any of us saw of Pluto.  Each of the eight other planets \u2013 or just \"eight planets\" as they are now \u2013 was a distinct world. Venus with its searing heat, crushing pressure and constant acid rain. Mars with its dramatic red hue. Jupiter with its streaming bands of colour and grab bag of moons, from volcanic Io to icy Europa. Saturn, of course, had its rings. Uranus was inexplicably upside-down. Neptune was a deep, cool shade of blue.  But Pluto was just a dot, and doomed to stay that way.  Even the Hubble Space Telescope couldn't do much with it. The Hubble is famous for producing staggeringly detailed images of deep space, like this celebrated shot:  In 1994 it took this image of Pluto and its largest moon Charon. Feel free to be underwhelmed.  Some years later it took a series of shots, which scientists overlaid to produce this map of Pluto \u2013 although you may feel that \"map\" is not quite the right word here.  Now we get to see it in full colour and high resolution, for the first time. It is, quite literally, our first look at an entirely new world.  Since the Neptune flyby in 1989, the space programme has made plenty of discoveries. A string of rovers have explored Mars, the Cassini probe has toured the moons of Saturn, and MESSENGER gave us our first complete map of Mercury. Perhaps most impressively, the Philae lander touched down on a comet.  But for me, there's nothing quite so thrilling as seeing something utterly new for the first time, after a lifetime of waiting.

Very cold. In fact, empty space, far from any star or other hot object, is about -270 degrees C.  While downright frigid\u2014a temperature low enough to freeze hydrogen on Earth\u2014that's still about 2.7 degrees above absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature. The source of those couple of degrees is primordial: the leftover glow of the big bang that gave birth to our universe.  The entire cosmos is bathed in this radiation, called the cosmic microwave background. As a result, it's hard to avoid this bit of heat, meaning that in most of the cosmos, -270 degrees is as cold as it gets.  But not everywhere.  5,000 light years away in Centaurus, a large constellation in the southern sky, is the Boomerang Nebula, a cloud of gas being expelled from a dying star.  > This is how stars die  This cloud is one of the most bizarre and mysterious objects in the universe. Here, within the gas streaming outwards, astronomers have found that the temperature drops as low as half a degree above absolute zero.  It is, as far as anyone knows, the coldest place in the universe.  It may also prove to be quite important. Because this most frigid place, and objects like it, albeit a tad warmer\u2014may help astronomers unravel a host of cosmic conundrums, from the violent yet spectacular deaths of stars and the formation of galaxies to cosmic explosions and the origin of life itself.  **Death of stars, birth of life**  In many respects the Boomerang Nebula is unremarkable. All stars have to die some day. When smaller stars end, those up to about eight times as massive as our own sun, they produce a similar display of gas and dust.  During this transformation, each dying low-mass star will cool and swell, becoming what's called a red giant. In a few billion years, when our own sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, it will similarly cool and grow, until it engulfs Mercury, Venus, and possibly even Earth.  The temperature of the star's outer layers drops low enough such that molecules start clumping together, condensing into dust particles. Starlight radiating from below smacks into these particles and ejects them outward. The particles drag the star's outer gas layers along, creating vast clouds like the ones seen in the Boomerang.  > In every which way we look at this object, it's extreme  Ultraviolet radiation from the dying star heats the gas, making it glow. Eventually, the radiation strips away the electrons from the atoms that make up the clouds. Once this ionisation process is complete, what\u2019s left is called a planetary nebula, which is a misnomer of a name, originating when astronomers a century ago mistook these bright objects for planets. Meanwhile, the dying star collapses into its final stage: a hot and dense object called a white dwarf. Our sun will collapse into a white dwarf the size of Earth.  \"This is how stars die,\" says Sun Kwok, an astronomer at the University of Hong Kong. \"They are born; they have a long life\u2014billions of years of life. And they die very suddenly over a very short period of time.\u201d  But that also means that objects such as the Boomerang Nebula are incredibly useful; as by studying them astronomers can solve the mysteries of stellar death. \"We're interested in how they die, why they die,\" Kwok says. \"The good thing is that before they die, they put up a huge spectacular show\u2014like fireworks.\"  And the deaths of stars play a crucial role in the birth of life. Astronomers have long known that many elements such as carbon, oxygen, and even iron are fused inside the cores of stars. When the stars die, those elements are distributed across the galaxy. And when very massive stars die\u2014those more than about eight times the mass of the sun\u2014they explode instead of creating planetary nebulae, creating even heavier elements that become the building blocks for rocks, planets, and even life.  In the last decade, Kwok says, he and his colleagues are learning that even planetary nebulae may be contributing to life by producing complex organic compounds. Some of these compounds may have made their way to our solar system as the planets were forming. And, they may have been key ingredients for the origin of life on Earth.  **A special nebula**  The Boomerang Nebula, however, is special.  For a start, the planetary nebula phase of a star's lifecycle lasts only a few tens of thousands of years. The Boomerang is not yet a full-fledged planetary nebula, since its central star hasn't ionised its surroundings. So it's a pre- planetary nebula, a transition stage that lasts only about a thousand years\u2014a mere blink in cosmic time, and one that we are lucky to witness.  Pre-planetary nebulae are important to astronomers such as Kwok because they provide a glimpse for how stars transform from a swollen red giant to a complex and dazzling planetary nebula. Although a dying star is round, a planetary nebula is not. It often has a bipolar shape, with lobes expanding out from two ends. As the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed in dramatic fashion, from our point of view on Earth, these nebulae sometimes appear to have intricate structures of interlocking rings and arcs.  > I don't think there's any theoretical explanation yet as to how this object is what it is right now  The metamorphosis of a round star into a planetary nebula is akin to a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, says Kwok, who did pioneering work on pre-planetary nebulae in the 1990s. Looking at the Boomerang, he says, is like peering into a cocoon just before a butterfly emerges.  But none of that explains why the Boomerang is so cold?  The Boomerang Nebula got its name because it appeared to have a curved shape like a boomerang. In 1995, Raghvendra Sahai, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and Lars-\u00c5ke Nyman, now at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope in Chile, took a closer look with a telescope in Chile, observing in millimetre wavelengths that revealed clouds of gas molecules. They found that the Boomerang wasn't a boomerang, but a round cloud expanding at a prodigious rate.  \"In every which way we look at this object, it's extreme,\" Sahai says.  He and Nyman discovered that the gas was gushing out at 164 km/s, almost 4,000 times faster than the average high-speed train and ten times faster than the typical speeds seen in similar objects. Such high speeds meant that for the last 1,500 years, the central star was losing mass at a rate of one- thousandths of a sun every year, ten times faster than what's been measured in similar stars that are ejecting gas.  This speed is why the Boomerang is so cold, Sahai explains.  Gas gets cold as it expands, which you can feel if you place your hand over a tyre nozzle as air is being let out. And if the gas expands as fast as it does in the Boomerang, it can get really cold. The nebula also contains a lot of gas, which makes it difficult for the ambient heat from the cosmic microwave background to seep in, helping the gas remain at a low temperature. With the exception of the artificial conditions created in certain laboratories on Earth, there's no known colder place in the universe.  The cold wasn't a complete surprise, however.  Sahai previously hypothesised that if certain conditions were just right, and if the central star were ejecting gas fast enough, the temperature could drop below the cosmic microwave background. Still, it was just a theoretical possibility. When he started analysing that Boomerang data nearly 20 years ago, however, he realised that his prediction was coming true. \"My hair stood on end,\" he recalls. \"That was one of the most exciting parts of my career.\"  Still, exactly how the central star ejects gas so fast remains a mystery, Sahai says.  According to conventional theory, it's the radiation from the star that's pushing out all that material. But, the star inside the Boomerang is nowhere bright enough to produce the radiation needed to cause gas to be ejected at 164 km/s. \"I don't think there's any theoretical explanation yet as to how this object is what it is right now,\" Sahai says.  Bizarre indeed.  **Boomerang revisited**  The Boomerang has also perplexed scientists in other ways. In the nearly two decades since the Boomerang was discovered to be the coldest region in the universe, Sahai and his colleagues have continued to explore the extreme object, slowly peeling back layers of complexity and mystery.  And one of the first puzzles to solve was its shape.  Sahai and Nyman's observations in submillimetre wavelengths revealed that the Boomerang consisted of a round, expanding molecular cloud. But what did it look like in visible light? In 1998, astronomers pointed the Hubble Space Telescope at the Boomerang to find out. The nebula didn't look round nor did it look like a boomerang. Instead, it boasted an hourglass figure.  Astronomers didn't know why the Boomerang looked so different in visible light compared to submillimetre, and the problem wasn't solved until last year, when Sahai and his colleagues described their latest observations using the new ALMA telescope in Chile, which allowed them make the most detailed observations of the nebula yet.  The researchers discovered that the Boomerang has a complex structure consisting of three parts. First, there is the large, round, expanding molecular gas cloud\u2014the same cloud that was observed earlier. But zooming in, the astronomers found a denser, doughnut-shaped cloud of dust surrounding the central star.  This dusty doughnut, the astronomers realised, acts like a mask, blocking the starlight emanating from the star's equator. Because light can only escape from the two poles, it illuminates the surrounding gas like two flashlights pointing in opposite directions. So the two lobes seen in the Hubble images are the beams of those flashlights shining through the gas\u2014just as how you can see the beams of a car's headlights on a foggy night.  > These are not just beautiful objects. They hold many secrets  The new ALMA observations showed why the Boomerang could appear both round and hourglass-shaped. But zooming in further, the astronomers found yet another structure: a hollow cylindrical nebula surrounding the central star. Sahai suspects that the cylindrical walls were formed by powerful jets of hydrogen or helium gas blasting from the star's poles, carving out a tunnel in the ambient gas.  **Jetting forward**  Where do these jets come from?  It turns out that jets are a common phenomenon in the universe, shooting out from many kinds of stars and even enormous black holes billions of times more massive than the sun. Although the details are unknown, they happen when a disc of gas and dust spirals into the star or black hole. The falling matter carries energy, which is released via narrow jets shooting out in opposite directions.  In planetary nebulae, these jets are made of gas. But in the supermassive black holes that reside at the centre of galaxies, they're likely charged particles blasting out at extreme speeds. These black-hole powered jets are so powerful that they can blow bubbles in the hot gas that permeates the space between the galaxies in a galaxy cluster. The way these jets inject heat and gas into their environments influences how galaxies form and evolve.  Even though the bubbles blown by these jets are up to a million times bigger and even though the gas, at tens of million of degrees, is far from cold, the general process is the same as what happens in systems such as the Boomerang, says astronomer Noam Soker of Technion University in Israel. So by studying the jets in the Boomerang and other planetary nebulae, astronomers can learn about galaxies and the supermassive black hole at their centres.  Jets are also thought to be involved in the strange explosions known as gamma- ray bursts, which are some of the most powerful cosmic phenomena observed, Soker says. He also thinks they may help drive supernovae\u2014the explosive deaths of very massive stars.  \"This is a highly controversial subject,\" he notes, as most astronomers think supernovae are propelled by an eruption of energetic particles called neutrinos. Still, current theories aren't satisfactory and the ubiquity of jets makes them a plausible mechanism, he says.  As for the Boomerang, there's still much to learn about what Sahai calls one of his favourite objects in the universe.  He and his colleagues plan to study it further with ALMA later this year. Their earlier observations showed that in the inner regions, the gas moves at a mere 35 km/s. With more detailed data, they hope to map exactly how fast different regions of the expanding gas cloud are moving. They also want to better understand the dusty doughnut at the centre.  The Boomerang is bizarre because it's a frigid place. But for astronomers, the nebula and its brethren are more than that. \"These are not just beautiful objects,\" Soker says. \"They hold many secrets.\"", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Why the coldest place in the universe is so special", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20140916-the-coldest-place-in-the-universe", "countriesMentioned": ["Chile", "Israel", "United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Marcus Woo"},{"newsText": "Look at the video above, and watch it to the end.  Notice something strange?  In a certain part of the universe, all the stars seem to have disappeared into a black void.  The new imagery was captured by the\u00a0European Southern Observatory (Eso) from the La Silla Observatory in Chile.  The black void it turns out, is actually a star nursery, a huge cloud of gas and stardust in which new stars are forming from the remnants of previously dead ones, giants that died as exploding supernovae.  The cloud is so dense it completely blocks out any light emanating from the stars behind, giving the appearance of being empty space.  .  **Baby stars**  This area is some 700 light-years away in a constellation named Serpens in the Northern hemisphere, first classified by Greek astronomer Ptolemy almost 2000 years ago.  > It's like watching a human just hours after being born, it's just a baby  The clouds pictured have their own name too, LDN 483 (Lynds Dark Nebula) and this dark nebula is a perfect location for the birth of these baby stars.  These forming stars are between several hundred thousand to a few million years old, explains Fernando Comeron, Eso's Chile representative.  This is \"basically nothing\" when considering the full length of a star's life, he says. \"It's like watching a human just hours after being born, it's just a baby.\"  That they are more than just black voids, he adds, is verified when looking at the infrared wavelengths observed through the obscuring dust. \"In the vast majority of such clouds, one finds star formation at work.\"  To put this in context, stars are known to live for hundreds of millions or even several billion years, indeed our own sun is already 4.6bn years-old.  And it is only in the last few decades that advances in technology have enabled researchers to probe inside such clouds. By doing so they can answer key questions about how the Universe has changed since its formation.  For one, stars were not yet present shortly after its formation, something the Plank satellite\u00a0has recently confirmed in astonishing detail.  The early Universe was thererfore a very different place than it is today, says Andrew Pontzen of University College London, UK.  Key questions remain for cosmologists such as Pontzen: how did all these stars form, how did our Universe become the one we know today where we have clumps of galaxies with hundreds of billions of stars in them?  We can't quite answer these questions but that's why it's so important to study the stars being born nearby, he says.  It will still take many millions of years before the young stars in this particular part of cloud become bright enough to shine through.

It is a cat seemingly like any other, only missing something: its tail.  The animal has captured the hearts of pet owners both on the island and much further afield. In fact, there are now far more Manx cats in North America than on the island where they originated.  How they came to lose their tails in the first place remains a bit of a mystery \u2013 but the answer lies in a genetic mutation.  In 2013, one gene was shown to have four possible mutations that can lead to a tailless Manx cat. All four mutations are specific to the Manx \u2013 other tailless or bob-tailed cats carry different mutations responsible for the trait.  The study\u2019s co-author Leslie Lyons, a cat expert and geneticist at the University of Missouri \u2013 Columbia, went to the Isle of Man herself to collect samples from Manx cats. The mutations were present there, meaning all Manx cats must have come from tailless cats on the island, which have lived there for hundreds of years.  Isle of Man resident Sara Goodwins, author of the book A De-tailed Account of Manx Cats, notes that the first linguistic reference to tailless cats on the Isle of Man appears in the mid-18th Century. Before that, since there was no special word for them, Goodwins says that it was unlikely they were present in any significant number.  Since cats use their tails for balance when running and jumping, and to communicate body language, it seems odd that some should lack them. Lyons says she cannot think of any natural advantage to being without a tail. Instead, the gene likely has been passed on mainly through selective breeding by humans, a process called \u201cnovelty selection\u201d.  Although the gene that carries these mutations is dominant, making it easy enough to pass on, there is an interesting quirk: if an unborn cat inherits the gene from both parents rather than just one, it will likely die in the womb. That is why the gene that causes the cats to have no tail has been nicknamed, darkly, \u201cthe lethal gene\u201d.  \u201cYou never see these babies born, or they never develop,\u201d says Lyons. \u201cThat means there is a high selection against this mutation.\u201d  Even when the gene is inherited from just one parent, it is not necessarily benign. Manx cats can suffer from health issues related to having too few vertebrae in the lower or lower-middle part of their spines, like incontinence and in some cases even lameness.  For this reason, some breeders will not try to preserve the gene, while others have specialised in trying to breed Manx cats with healthier spines.  The introduction of problematic traits in domesticated animals is a phenomenon that is gradually becoming better understood.  For example, a 2016 study of dogs suggested that small domestic populations led to the accumulation of harmful genes in animals that were selectively bred for certain physical features, such as colour or shape of the head.  Even more troubling is a practice called \u201cdocking\u201d, in which the tails of young cats and dogs are surgically removed so that they appear to have been born without tails. The process is banned as a\u00a0cosmetic measure in the UK, except for working dogs used by the police and armed services.  However, Manx owners say that their breeding has not just caused them to lose their tails, but other feline characteristics, too. \u201cA Manx cat will go for a walk with you,\u201d says Goodwins. \u201cMost cats hate water but Manx cats like swimming.\u201d  It is not clear why they behave this way.  Goodwins\u2019 personal theory is that the Manx genome was influenced by the introduction of Scandinavian cat breeds to the Isle of Man when Vikings arrived there over a millennium ago. Today\u2019s Norwegian forest cats, which share some of the Manx\u2019s doglike characteristics, are likely descended from cats that Vikings kept.  However, Lyons says that she is not aware of any genetic evidence that would back up Goodwins' idea.  \u201cThey\u2019re not similar to one another [genetically], but they are similar to random bred cats,\u201d she says. The Manx genome is like the Norwegian forest cat\u2019s only in the sense that they are both highly diverse: if a cat has been bred from many different breeds, it will \u201cmatch\u201d with a Manx simply because the two share diverse genomes.  The Manx cat, then, may be an oddity but it reveals much about our attitudes towards domesticated animals. As our understanding of genetics has improved, so has our understanding of the Manx.  Whether it will be deemed ethical to preserve Manx mutations in the future is unclear. But the cat certainly has, against all the odds, survived and thrived, even far from its native shores.  For a humble islander without a tail, the Manx has \u2013 if nothing else \u2013 certainly travelled well.  _This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

They have no sense of smell. The world would be better off without them._  **_Reality:_**_ Not all vultures are bald. Some are even beautiful, especially in flight. Irrespective of appearance, they play a hugely important role as biological waste controllers. The world is better off with vultures, for sure._  With their archetypal ugliness and scavenging antics, vultures are easy to malign.  The lappet-faced vulture has an undeniably shifty appearance. When asked to picture a vulture, it is this species \u2013 with its hunched stance, naked neck and featherless scalp \u2013 that comes to mind.  But the contempt for vultures based on their alien looks and scavenging habits is quite obviously silly. There is a lot to admire about vultures.  Wildlife documentaries do not help.  The dominant motif is on the African savannah, a wake of vultures lurching, lunging and bickering over the remains of some poor mammal. One bird pulls its head out of the carcass and turns its face to camera, covered in blood and guts.  \"I understand why people don't like them,\" says Mark Habben, curator of birds at London Zoo in the UK.  But in flight the vulture comes into its own, he says. \"It's an absolutely stunning animal.\"  The large wings are not for flapping but for gliding.  Back in the 1960s, zoologist Colin Pennycuick climbed into a Schleicher ASK-14 powered sailplane and took to Tanzanian airspace, mostly above the Serengeti, to study the gliding flight of the white-backed vulture _Gyps africanus_.  As he motored along in search of targets to photograph, tawny eagles and martial eagles were occasionally attracted to his airplane \"within 2-3 m of the cockpit in a somewhat menacing fashion\".  Pennycuick found that the vultures could bank in impressively tight circles without falling from the sky. The size and shape of their wings allowed them to exploit \"tiny (and often transient) patches of lift as early as 08.30h\".  By 9.30 in the morning, the vultures were flying successfully at heights of 300m or more above the ground.  All 23 species of vulture use this thermal soaring to gain an aerial vantage. \"They are looking out for a recent kill and looking out for the descent of other vultures,\" says Habben.  Vultures have legendary long-distance vision, but they may not be able to see in front of them at all. Whilst some birds have a field of view approaching 360\u00b0, the visual field of vultures is severely limited at around 60\u00b0.  That may sound silly, but vultures' insensitivity to anything above the horizontal effectively eliminates the blinding glare from the Sun, helping them to focus on what's going on beneath them.  This may also explain why vultures have prominent supra-orbital ridges (brows) and long lashes.  Vultures excel in other senses as well. In particular, anyone who believes that vultures can't smell should go and meet a turkey vulture.  In 1938, some bright spark at Union Oil in California noticed that turkey vultures seemed to be homing in on a known leak in a gas pipeline. That suggested that the species might be used to pinpoint other sites of wastage.  In the 1960s, ornithologist Kenneth Stager of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History in California confirmed that turkey vultures were responding to ethanethiol. This chemical is a pungent byproduct of decaying organic matter, and energy companies use it to give odourless gas an easily identifiable smell.  At a kill, things do admittedly get a little ugly. The competition can be fierce and fights are inevitable.  Feeding itself is not particularly well-mannered. Vultures often dine out on the dead animal's eyes and anus before moving on to less penetrable tissues.  The blood from the carcasses helps explain why most vultures come close to baldness. \"It would destroy the feathers,\" says Habben, whereas blood on skin will just dry and flake off.  The bearded vulture, which prefers bones to flesh, has kept its feathered head.  Perhaps you're still not convinced about vultures. If they disappeared, would anyone really miss them?  The unequivocal answer to this question comes from India, where cattle have been widely treated with an anti-inflammatory drug called diclofenac. This drug has effectively poisoned vultures that dined out on the cattle's remains.  Between 1992 and 2007, the population of oriental white-rumped vultures is estimated to have declined by 99.9%. Long-billed vultures and slender-billed vultures suffered a similar fate.  In the absence of vultures, there was a build-up of carcasses. These posed a significant risk to human health, as they both harboured deadly diseases like anthrax and contaminated water sources.  The decaying cattle remains also resulted in an explosion of the feral dog population, rising from around 20 million to 30 million in the course of a decade. It's been estimated that the ensuing increase in rabies cases cost over $30 billion.  Vultures are biological waste controllers. \"Without them the consequences are significant,\" says Habben. \"We need them more than we recognise.\"", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The truth about vultures", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150713-the-truth-about-vultures", "countriesMentioned": ["British Indian Ocean Territory", "Central African Republic", "United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Henry Nicholls"},{"newsText": "When it comes to underdog planets, Ceres might be at the top of the list.

Despite this humble status, Ceres is proving to be way more interesting than just another space rock.  For instance, Ceres is one of the most watery worlds in the solar system, with water comprising about 15 percent of its mass and a third of its volume, according to the latest estimates. Most of the water is locked up in ice, but scientists think that deep in its interior, some of it may be liquid. As water is necessary for life, this has implications for habitability.  That's not to say Ceres is home to aliens but such a world contains vital clues about the origins of life - on Earth and beyond.    As the only icy body of its kind in the inner solar system, Ceres represents one of the key building blocks that formed the planets. \"It's an example of the last step before planet-hood,\" says Andy Rivkin, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University in the US. Ceres is a remnant of the past, and to explore it is to excavate the solar system's history.  The Dawn spacecraft, now in orbit around Ceres, is doing just that. Its mission is far from over, but it's already revealed a wondrous, cratered surface, discovering a world that's not a dull chunk of ice and rock, but one that's alive and kicking.  **A unique world**  By the end of the 18th century, astronomers knew of seven planets, having just added Uranus to the mix in 1781. But between Mars and Jupiter was a curiously wide gap. According to an empirical law known as the Titius-Bode law, the distance between the sun and the planets followed a distinct pattern. If the pattern held, there should be a planet right in that gap.  So when an Italian monk named Giuseppe Piazzi discovered Ceres on New Year's Day in 1801, astronomers rejoiced. Not only had they finally found the missing planet, but it was also only the second time anyone had identified a new planet in modern times.    Even though astronomers found three more bodies in similar orbits over the next few years, Ceres kept its planetary status. It remained a planet for almost 50 years, after astronomers discovered Neptune (which, incidentally, didn't follow the Titius-Bode pattern).  > When it was discovered, it was thought of as a planet, it's been downhill since then  By then, thanks to improved telescopes, astronomers were finding more and more objects near Ceres. They realised that it was just one of an entirely new class of bodies. Instead of a planet, Ceres was dubbed a \"minor planet\" or an asteroid.  \"Poor Ceres got demoted,\" says Chris Russell, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"In 1801, when it was discovered, it was thought of as a planet, and it's been downhill since then.\"  Ceres has languished as just another member of the asteroid belt, albeit the largest. Still, most people thought it was simply a big rock. \"Even among scientists, I think we only really realised how weird or how different it was in last 10 to 15 years,\" Rivkin says.  > The solar system is a wet place  Scientists could only make more accurate measurements of its mass about 15 year ago, he says, revealing Ceres to be less dense than previously thought. This was a key revelation, showing that Ceres must contain huge quantities of ice mixed with rock.  That ice in itself isn't unique. As multiple spacecraft have discovered, the solar system is a wet place. Comets, the moons of Saturn, Jupiter and even Pluto and its moon Charon, have lots of ice. Some places, like Europa and Ganymede, may contain vast subsurface oceans. Saturn and Jupiter have other small, icy moons comparable to Ceres as well. But when you consider Ceres's size, silicate rocky composition, and its location in the asteroid belt, it's one of a kind.  It wasn't always special. About 4.5 billion years ago, as the planets were just beginning to form, the solar system was home to perhaps tens of thousands of icy bodies like Ceres. They collided and merged to form the worlds we know today - including Earth.  > Icy bodies like Ceres were key ingredients not just for planets, but also for life on Earth  If they didn't coalesce into planets, they got smashed into smaller pieces, becoming the floating detritus that fills the asteroid belt. Luckily for us, Ceres survived.  Icy bodies like Ceres were key ingredients not just for planets, but also for life on Earth. To fill its oceans, where life first evolved, icy objects such as comets and Ceres-like bodies must have crashed into the planet, delivering water in the process.  Then there's the prospect of life existing on Ceres itself. About 950 km across and 80 times less massive than the moon, Ceres is too small to have an atmosphere, and neither liquid water nor ice can survive for long on its surface. But, below the surface is a different story.  When Ceres first formed, it was hot enough to melt ice, which made it easier for water and rock to separate. That allowed heavier, rocky material to sink toward the centre while the water remained, forming the mantle.  Ceres cooled from the outside in, so while its outer layers are now a frozen mixture of ice and clay, some of the water in its interior might still be liquid. Just maybe, somewhere inside Ceres is an environment warm and wet enough for life.  While no one expects to find aliens on Ceres, it does have some advantages over other possible life-harbouring worlds like Europa and Ganymede. Ceres is closer to the Sun, so it enjoys some extra warmth that might be needed to nurture life.  It's also free of the radiation-filled environment that Jupiter's magnetic field creates around Europa and Ganymede. \"I would say Ceres is more user friendly to life than we would get in the interior of Europa or Ganymede,\" Russell says.  In 2014, Ceres got even more interesting. The Herschel space telescope detected water vapour spraying from the dwarf planet \\- the first definitive detection of water from an object in the asteroid belt. The vapour seemed to come and go at different times, prompting speculation for cryogenic volcanoes or other geologic activity.  **Dawn arrives**  To figure out what exactly was triggering those apparent plumes, scientists would need to take a closer look. Fortunately, a spacecraft was already on its way.  Dawn launched in 2007, and after more than a year exploring Vesta, the second most massive asteroid, it headed towards Ceres. As the round, cratered world came into focus, scientists noticed a big white spot, shining bright in stark contrast to the drab, grey surface.  > Such watery eruptions could be a direct link to wet, potentially habitable environments  Upon getting closer, Dawn revealed it was not one spot but two, so bright that UFO enthusiasts speculated they were signs of Ceresian beings.  But scientists had a few more likely hypotheses. The spots could be sunlight reflecting off patches of recently formed ice. Or Dawn was actually peering straight into cryogenic volcanoes or geysers.  Not only would that mean Ceres was geologically active, but also that water was reaching the surface. Such watery eruptions could be a direct link to wet, potentially habitable environments below.  By the time Dawn entered an orbit around Ceres in March 2015, scientists found many other smaller spots across its surface. As for the big ones, they turned out to be a cluster of smaller dots, all inside a 90 km-wide crater named Occator.  Now that Dawn has spiraled into an orbit just 1,470 km above Ceres, scientists have pretty much ruled out geysers or volcanoes, says Russell, who is the principal investigator of the Dawn mission.  **Salty spots**  After more careful measurements, researchers found that those spots were not reflecting as much light as they thought. At best, they were only bouncing back 50 percent of any incoming light, which is not shiny enough to be an icy geyser.  The spots are not likely to be patches of ice either. Surface ice does not last very long before sublimating away, and Dawn's camera and infrared spectrometer has not detected any chemical signs of ice. So far, Russell says, the most likely possibility is that the spots are salt - not table salt, but chemical salts like magnesium sulfate.  That might not sound as exciting as erupting geysers, but salt still points to flowing water. \"That's just as good an indicator of water because the salt isn't just going to float out of the body itself,\" Russell says. \"It's going to be carried out by liquid to get it to the surface.\"  What scientists do not yet know is whether water is depositing salt now, or if the salt formed last year, or even millions of years ago. But by comparing old Hubble images of Ceres with Dawn's, researchers can determine if the spots have changed - and if water is still delivering salt to the surface today.  Meanwhile, Dawn continues to reveal more surprises. It has detected a thin layer of haze filling most of Occator crater, but remaining just below the rim.  > Ceres is going to be a great place for a follow-up mission  Dawn is not yet close enough to measure any details about the haze, other than the fact that it's scattering light. But if it turns out to be water vapour - perhaps related to the watery process that's depositing salt on the surface - it could be the same vapour that Herschel detected last year.  Maybe the strangest thing, other than the spots, is a lone, pyramid-shaped mountain that towers 6 km above the surface. At first glance, Russell says, it's similar to the ice mountains the New Horizons spacecraft recently discovered on Pluto. The same processes that formed the mountains might be at work on both dwarf planets.  The mountain could also be a permafrost mound called a pingo, which can be seen in places like Alaska and perhaps Mars, Russell says.  On Earth, pingos form when a mound of ice grows underneath frozen soil, getting as high as 50 metres. Dawn scientists are now scouring the images of Ceres for similar mounds. Due to the weaker gravity on Ceres, Russell explains, pingos might be able to grow as high as the pyramid mountain.  > Eventually, maybe humans will pay a visit  Dawn will continue to collect data from its current orbit until autumn, before dropping to a mere 375 km from the surface in December. Dawn will then continue circling Ceres indefinitely, at least until its primary mission is over next summer. But the end of Dawn isn't necessarily the end for exploring Ceres.  \"Ceres is going to be a great place for a follow-up mission,\" Rivkin says. \"Something like a Ceres rover.\" Ceres would also be a great testing ground for a potential lander on Europa. Both the European Space Agency and NASA have started planning missions, but only to orbit the icy moon. With the possibility of a subsurface ocean, drilling into its surface would be more exciting.  Drilling on a moon like Europa is still a long way off, however. Getting to Ceres would be a simper mission as it's much closer and in a relatively radiation-free environment. Eventually, maybe humans will even pay a visit, Rivkin says. \"Ceres is a good spot for a post-Mars target.\"  On the tiny chance that there is life on Ceres, it will take a lander to find it. \"I have no evidence at all and I don't expect we would get any evidence for life on Ceres,\" Russell says. \"But if there were a mission that wanted to go out and explore whether there was evidence of life on Ceres, I would certainly vote for it.\"  Even if Ceres was not home to alien critters, the world itself seems to be alive, with whiffs of water vapour, frozen mountains, maybe flowing water and whatever else Dawn will uncover in the coming months. In Russell's eyes, that kind of activity should make Ceres a bona fide planet.  In fact, when the International Astronomical Union voted to make Pluto and Ceres dwarf planets in 2006, they could have gone the other way and declared both planets. The first proposed definition of a planet said it was anything orbiting a star that's big enough to be round, which would have included Ceres and other objects in the outer solar system, expanding the planetary club to 12.  But alas, astronomers adopted a more stringent definition, requiring a planet to not only be round, but to have cleared its orbit. This rules out Ceres and Pluto because of their places in the asteroid and Kuiper belts, respectively.  For now, Ceres remains officially a dwarf planet. Whatever you call it, though, you can't say it's boring.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Ceres: The planet that wasn't", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150831-the-planet-that-wasnt", "countriesMentioned": ["United States", "France", "Italy", "Brazil", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Argentina", "Canada"], "author": "Marcus Woo"},{"newsText": "**Giant armadillo (_Priodontes maximus_)**  You think you'd notice something the size of a large pig, covered in scales with 20cm (8\") front claws like scimitar blades. But the giant armadillo does such a good job of hiding, scientists have had to install secret cameras to find out more about it.  \"Very few people have seen a giant armadillo in the wild,\" says Arnaud Desbiez, who runs the Giant Armadillo Project in Brazil. \"In our field site the owner of the ranch, who was born and raised here, had never seen a giant armadillo before we started the project.\"  Weighing up to 50kg (110 lb) and reaching 1.5m (5 ft) in length, it is the largest species of armadillo.  At nearly twice the size of other species, its girth makes it unable to roll into the family's distinctive ball-shape for defence. Instead, it digs underground burrows with its impressive front claws. It only ventures outside under cover of darkness.  The giant armadillo is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and hunting, but local people are said to regard sightings of them as bad omens. The rare camera trap photographs may help to highlight its situation.  **Giant squid (_Architeuthis_)**  Possibly the most infamous of giant animals lurks beneath the waves. The giant squid earns its name from a body size of up to 5m (16.5 ft) and a pair of elongated tentacles that can bring it to an overall length of 13m (42.5 ft).  It is a predator, known for its huge flesh-ripping beak and eyes the size of footballs. But as a denizen of the deep ocean, living as far down as 1000m (3,280 ft), it is a species that very few people have seen alive.  Salty sea tales claim that monstrously large animals have destroyed ships, but documented encounters are rare. Most take place on the water's surface, when the squid is injured or dying.  The first footage of a giant squid in its natural deep-water environment was filmed in 2012.  The project was organised by a team of international scientists who launched a submersible vehicle off the coast of Japan. With a bit of bait and a lot of luck, an animal appeared in front of their cameras.  **Giant otter (_Pteronura brasiliensis_)**  While it lacks elephants, tropical South America is still a land of giant animals. The continent is home to the biggest members of the armadillo and anteater families, as well as the capybara, the world's largest rodent.  In the rivers east of the Andes lives the giant otter. Twice the size of the next biggest member of its family, the giant otter can reach 2m (6.5 ft) in length.  It lives in open habitats in large family groups, and is consequently quite easy to spot.  While giant otters can deal with natural predators such as caiman and jaguars, they have fallen victim to man. They are described as sociable and curious, and this gregarious character has made them a target for hunters.  The thick pelt was once highly sought after, with devastating consequences. The trade was banned in 1975 but now the remaining animals are threatened by increasing human settlement in their Amazonian habitat.  Conflict arises with fishermen, and mismanaged tourism is also having an impact, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Populations in the protected Pantanal wetland are thought to have recovered, but it remains to be seen how the otters will cope with the rising human population.  **Giant huntsman spider****\u00a0(****_Heteropoda maxima_****)**  If you measure spider size by leg span, the largest reaches 30cm (1 ft) across and goes by the worrying name \"giant huntsman spider\". Fortunately, it confines its predatory activities to insects.  You're unlikely to see one scurrying across your carpet, unless you've set up home in a cave in Laos. Even there it would now be a rare sight.  _Heteropoda maxima_ made headlines among arachnophobes and -philes alike when it was discovered in 2001 by Dr Peter Jaegar of Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany.  Jaegar says the resulting attention has been bad news for the spider, due to unregulated demand by the pet trade. He suggests that for every 100 spiders imported as pets, 1000 more may have perished when removed from their homes.  \"In 2009, my PhD student and I could observe the impact in easily-accessible caves, where no adults could be found,\" says Jaegar. He says the spiders survive for little more than a year outside of the controlled climate of their caves.  Jaegar says their short-lived nature may ultimately reduce demand.  **Giant oarfish (_Regalecus glesne_)**  Looking very much like an enormous sea serpent, the giant oarfish is extremely flat and undulates through the water like a wide silver ribbon.  Its long pelvic fins look like oars and it has a distinctive red crest. But the most remarkable thing about the oarfish is its extreme length. Measured at up to 17m (56 ft), it is the world's longest bony fish.  Despite its massive size, the giant oarfish remains quite mysterious. It lives in the deep ocean alongside other giant species. It's not clear why deep- dwelling species are often so big: low temperatures, high pressure, a lack of currents or a scarcity of food have all been put forward as explanations.  Because of its deep-dwelling habits, the giant oarfish is a rare sight. In recent years, unmanned submersibles have managed to film it in its natural environment, but very few people have seen a healthy one in the flesh.  Giant oarfish only appear at the surface when dead or injured. Where one washes in to shore, it is usually photographed being held aloft by large groups of people to show its relative size.  In June 2015, Santa Catalina Island off the coast of California hosted its third giant oarfish in as many years when a 5.2m (17 ft) specimen washed ashore.  **Goliath frog****\u00a0(_Conraua goliath_)**  The world's largest frog can weigh as much as a newborn baby, tipping the scales at 3.2kg (7lbs).  The goliath frog might be huge, but like many of its amphibian cousins it does its best to conceal itself. Mottled green camouflage helps it to hide among the moss-covered rocks.  It lives in or near fast-flowing rivers in the coastal rainforests of west Africa.  You might think it would have an impressive croak to match its bulk, but you'd be wrong. Unlike most other frogs, the goliath frog does not possess a vocal sac, so it whistles to attract mates instead.  Despite its stealthy adaptations, the goliath frog is an endangered species.  Its population has reportedly declined by 50% in the last three generations. The frogs are widely hunted as a delicacy and for the international pet trade, notably for frog-jumping competitions in the US.  While some frogs have been exported for captive breeding programmes, these have so far proven unsuccessful. Instead conservationists are concentrating on local communities, in a bid to curb unsustainable hunting.  **Chan's megastick****\u00a0(****_Phobaeticus chani_****)**  While most insects can fit in the palm of your hand, there are a few giants out there. The longest in the world is a stick insect that lives in Borneo. It was named after its discoverer as Chan's megastick in 2008.  The largest known example is over 0.5m (22\") long with legs outstretched and is kept at the Natural History Museum in London, UK.  Very little is known about the insect because in the wild it is exceptionally difficult to see. Males are brown and females mottled green, and both are long and spindly, so they are perfectly camouflaged in their rainforest home.  To further mimic the plants around them, the eggs of the insect resemble seeds and have wing-like extensions, which are thought to help them to disperse on the wind.  Experts believe Chan's megastick lives in the forest canopy, making it even more challenging to find. Only a handful of specimens are currently known to science.  **Queen Alexandra's birdwing (_Ornithoptera alexandrae_)**  In Papua New Guinea, there is a butterfly so large it earns comparison with a bird.  The Queen Alexandra's birdwing lives in a small area of rainforest near the north coast.  Males are spectacular, with blue-green iridescent streaks on velvet black wings and a bright yellow abdomen, while the females are slightly more reserved with cream accents. However females are a third larger than males, with a record-breaking wingspan of up to 30cm (1 ft).  Following its initial discovery in 1906, the insect was highly prized by collectors and as a result it was severely over-harvested. It flies fast through the rainforest canopy and proved difficult to capture, so hunters used shotguns loaded with salt to bring it down.  A law was introduced in 1966 to protect the butterfly, but continued illegal collection and habitat destruction for logging and palm oil has dramatically decreased its population.  Few outside of Oro province have seen the endangered Queen Alexandra's birdwing in flight and even there sightings are dwindling. Local tribes and conservationists are now fighting for its future.  **Giant isopod**\u00a0**_(Bathynomus giganteus)_**  Imagine a woodlouse that can grow longer than a cat, 76cm (2.5 ft) long \u2013 and weigh 1.7kg (3.75 lb). Well, it exists and it's called the giant isopod.  It is a crustacean, distantly related to shrimp and crabs. It lives far beneath the waves where growing to relatively giant proportions is not uncommon.  This oversized roly-poly shares its terrestrial cousins' rigid exoskeleton and ability to roll into a ball for defence. It has seven pairs of legs, two sets of sensitive antennae and large compound eyes. It is a pale lilac colour.  In cold waters off the US coast it inhabits the sea bed, feasting on the corpses of whales, fish and squid. Food is a rare resource when you live as far down as 2000m (6560 ft) below sea level so when this scavenger finds a meal it attacks.  Its targets can include fishermen's trawl nets, and most encounters with the creature occur when it is dragged to the surface as bycatch. In 2010, a huge specimen was found latched onto a remotely-operated vehicle being used in sea surveys.  Such wild encounters with the animal are rare, but several are held in aquarium collections around the world, and they are particular favourites in Japan.  **Blakiston's fish owl (_Bubo blakistoni_)**  There is some debate over which owl gets to lift the title of world's largest, but the Blakiston's fish owl is a heavyweight contender. It reaches up to 4.6kg (10 lb) in weight with a wingspan nearing 2m (6.5 ft).  It was discovered by naturalist Thomas Blakiston in 1883. As its name suggests, the massive owl feeds primarily on fish.  Living in riverside forest in Siberia, northeast China, North Korea and northern Japan, it cuts a bulky figure among the tree tops.  But this is now a rare sight. Under increasing pressure from logging, overfishing and persecution by hunters, Blakiston's fish owl is now officially considered an endangered species.  In Hokkaido, Japan, the owl was traditionally considered a spirit that protected the villages of the indigenous Ainu people. Now, roles are reversed and conservationists watch over the owls with the help of nest box cameras.  Thanks to these huge artificial homes, the decline of owls has been halted. But without the mature forests they depend on, their future is unclear.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - Giant animals that are almost impossible to find", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150720-giant-animals-youve-never-seen", "countriesMentioned": ["Japan", "Brazil", "China", "Central African Republic", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "Germany", "South Africa", "Russia", "Trinidad and Tobago"], "author": "Ella Davies"},{"newsText": "Sit back and take a ride from the Sun to Jupiter, at the speed of light.

The small, sometimes overlooked world was finally the star of the show.  Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft, about the size of a baby grand piano, was approaching its primary destination after a nine-year, nearly five-billion-km journey. As it hurtled towards Pluto at 50,000 km/h, it sent back tantalising images of ever increasing detail.  > We've crossed the threshold, gone where no one has gone before  From a glowing speck, Pluto grew into a textured disk of light until, finally, on 14 July 2015, a fully-fledged world came into view. New Horizons got within 12,500km \u2013 less than an Earth's diameter \u2013 of the distant, icy dwarf planet. It was the closest any human-made object had ever come to Pluto.  The snapshot of a reddish world bearing a giant heart instantly became an icon. For a mission that was expecting the unexpected, New Horizons discovered an astounding place with dramatic and wide-ranging landscapes that would amaze even the most hardened of space explorers.  \"We all thought it was going to be interesting, and we all hoped it was going to be diverse,\" says\u00a0Bill McKinnon, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and a member of the mission's science team. \"It exceeded all of our expectations.\"  Already, the discoveries have reshaped our understanding of Pluto and also of the outer Solar System. Knowing what is hiding in these remote regions will help scientists piece together the history of how the Solar System formed.  \"This mission is our gateway,\" McKinnon says. \"We've crossed the threshold, gone where no one has gone before: into the Kuiper Belt.\"  For most of the time that humans have known Pluto, since Clyde Tombaugh discovered it in 1930, it represented the final frontier. It was the last planet, and the misfit that stood out from the rest. Whereas the other outer planets are giant, puffy balls of gas, Pluto is rocky, icy, and smaller than Earth.  At an average distance of almost six billion km from the Sun, Pluto was a mysterious, faint world, beyond the reach of the most powerful telescopes. Even the mighty Hubble Space Telescope could muster nothing more than a pixelated blob.  In the early 1990s, astronomers started to realise Pluto was not alone. They discovered that the outer Solar System was filled with a swarm of small, icy objects they eventually dubbed the Kuiper Belt, a ring beyond Neptune's orbit.  Then, in 2005, astronomers found that one of these objects, later named Eris, rivals Pluto in size. The discovery of something so big called into question Pluto's status as a unique and isolated planet. Pluto, it now seemed, might be just like Eris \u2013 a part of the Kuiper Belt. That is why Pluto never fit in with the other planets: it belonged to this other group of outcasts. After heated debate, astronomers made it official in 2006 and voted to demote Pluto to a dwarf planet.  While some lamented Pluto's exit from the planet club, the new classification signified a deeper understanding of the outer Solar System. Instead of the lone, distant oddball at the end of the planetary line, Pluto was the beginning of something more: a previously unknown and unexplored collection of ice and rock \u2013 and possibly new worlds.  It was a new vision of the final frontier, enticing enough that Nasa decided to send New Horizons to explore Pluto, its moons, and maybe another Kuiper Belt Object. The mission launched in January 2006, just a few months before Pluto's demotion.  > You knew it was going to be weird, and you knew it would be different from everything we had ever seen  With spacecraft having visited every other planet in the Solar System, New Horizons would fill the last remaining gap of exploration. But despite more than four decades of encountering other alien worlds, scientists could not have foreseen what they would find on Pluto.  Now, more than a year after New Horizons showed us Pluto in all its detail, the spacecraft has sent back 80% of its data, with the rest coming in October 2016. Scientists are sifting through the torrent of information, piecing together a world of startling variety and complexity.  \"You knew it was going to be weird, and you knew it would be different from everything we had ever seen,\" says\u00a0Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, US, one of the discoverers of Eris, and self- described Pluto killer. \"But there was just no way to predict what it was going to look like.\"  Pluto is far. Really far. While sunlight takes only eight minutes to reach Earth, the trip to Pluto is more than five hours. And even then not much light or heat gets there \u2013 the Sun is 1,500 times fainter than it appears on Earth. The average temperature is about -230 degrees Celsius. Such a frigid surface should be frozen and relatively dormant.  > This was stuff that was over the top \u2013 people would've laughed at us  Still, astronomers had long known Pluto's surface was at least somewhat active. Pluto's extreme seasons lead to wild temperature swings, driving changes in the ices and its thin atmosphere.  \"We knew the atmosphere and surface were coupled and things would be moving around on Pluto timescales,\" McKinnon says. \"But it's another thing altogether to say there are moving glaciers, floating ice mountains, convection, or a vast frozen sea of solid nitrogen. This was stuff that was over the top \u2013 people would've laughed at us.\"  Indeed, New Horizons discovered a surface beyond anyone's imagination. Much of the giant heart that dominates the now-famous photo of Pluto turns out to be an enormous glacier, the biggest in the Solar System. It is a vast chunk of frozen nitrogen creeping across the surface.  More detailed images revealed polygonal shapes etched onto this glacial surface, called Sputnik Planum.\u00a0Computer models and further analysis\u00a0show that these shapes, as wide as 50km across, are churning convection cells. This is where the downward pressure from surface ice warms the ice underneath. Since heat rises, the warmer ice below flows upward and forces the surface ice downward, driving the ice into a circular motion called convection.  This motion is slow, cycling every half a million years or so. The ice itself only moves across a few centimetres per year. Still, the very existence of such an energetic process was shocking.  \"The whole idea of glacial ices and flow, and current activity on Pluto was really contrary to previous thought,\" says\u00a0Cathy Olkin\u00a0of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado US, and one of the mission's deputy project scientists.  Beyond Sputnik Planum, jagged mountains of water ice punctuate more rugged terrain. Some are only about 100 million years old: remarkably young, given that Pluto and the rest of the Solar System is about 4.6 billion years old. Such vigorous geology was surprisingly recent.  Two of Pluto's highest mountains \u2013 Wright Mons and Piccard Mons, rising to about 4km and 5.6km, respectively \u2013 might even be volcanic, spewing out water ice, methane, nitrogen, ammonia, and other icy compounds. Unlike some of the other icy volcanoes, called cryovolcanoes, in the Solar System, such as the spouts on Jupiter's moon Ganymede and Saturn's moon Enceladus, these volcanoes have formed towering structures, more similar to the ones we think of on Earth, according to McKinnon.  > Even the possibility of an ocean is cause for excitement,  But Pluto may have at least one intriguing similarity to some of these moons: a subsurface ocean of liquid water. Soon after Pluto formed, radioactive elements buried in the core might have melted some of the surrounding ice. Over time, as Pluto cooled, that liquid water would refreeze. Because ice occupies more volume than liquid water, Pluto would have expanded, forming cracks on its frozen surface \u2013 exactly the kind of cracks that New Horizons discovered.  But if the underground liquid completely froze over,\u00a0recent computer models suggest that it would have formed a special kind of ice that is denser than both normal ice and liquid water. If that were the case, Pluto would have shrunk, leaving behind tell-tale fault lines across the surface. But New Horizons did not see any of these lines, suggesting some of the water inside Pluto is still liquid.  Much of the evidence is circumstantial, and before they can be sure, scientists will need to send a spacecraft to study Pluto's interior structure from orbit, which will not happen anytime soon. Still, even the possibility of an ocean is cause for excitement, not only for Pluto but also other Kuiper Belt Objects.  According to theory, more Pluto-sized worlds could be floating in the outer regions of the Kuiper Belt. And if Pluto has glaciers, cryovolcanoes, and oceans, then it is plausible that these other objects would as well.  > If we look at Eris tomorrow, we'll probably find areas that look exactly like Pluto  As the first such object a spacecraft has visited, and one of the largest, Pluto is a sign of what else could be out there. For the first time, scientists have a concrete image of what some of these Kuiper Belt Objects may be like.  \"If you accept this idea that Pluto has an ocean, there are probably a large number of icy worlds in the Kuiper Belt and beyond that possess these deep dark oceans,\" McKinnon says.  Even if other Kuiper Belt Objects do not have oceans, they could still bear a resemblance to Pluto.  \"Each one will be different for slightly different reasons \u2013 but similar- looking,\" Brown says. \"They will suddenly look familiar, instead of bizarre. If we look at Eris tomorrow, we'll probably find areas that look exactly like Pluto and vice versa.\"  The Kuiper Belt sits between about 35 and 45 astronomical units from the Sun; an astronomical unit (au) being the average distance between the Sun and Earth. Astronomers have scoured this region, uncovering only a handful of objects like Eris that are big enough to merit dwarf planet status.  > In principle there could be a handful of Pluto-sized bodies out there  \"But if you went out to three times the typical Kuiper Belt distance to 100 or 150 au, they could be hiding out there,\" says\u00a0Wes Fraser, an astronomer at Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. \"All you need is a darker surface than Pluto and a good distance, and you could hide objects that are that size.\"  It turns out that, despite such large distances, the surface temperatures at these far-flung worlds might only be about 10 degrees colder than Pluto, Fraser says. This means they could be as wonderfully dynamic and diverse. \"Geologically speaking, if Pluto is an active body, I wouldn't see why a Pluto at 1,000 au wouldn't also be an active body,\" he says.  In principle, he says, there could be a handful of Pluto-sized bodies out there. Current theory says Kuiper Belt Objects of all sizes formed much closer to the Sun \u2013 including perhaps as many as a few thousand Pluto-sized ones.  But a series of violent gravitational interactions with gas giant planets scattered these chunks of ice and rock, sending some plunging into the Sun, and others out of the Solar System altogether. The ones that were left became the Kuiper Belt. Still others, including a few Pluto-sized objects, could have settled in the outer edge of the Kuiper Belt.  > It was a fantastic voyage to the very edge of the Solar System, and we're not done  Future telescopes like the\u00a0Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, scheduled to begin operation in 2023, will explore these regions of space, hunting for distant Kuiper Belt Objects. Being able to gauge what is out there will be crucial for testing today's theories for how the Solar System formed.  New Horizons' visit to Pluto was brief. But its mission continues, and on the first day of 2019, the spacecraft will zoom by a much smaller Kuiper Belt Object called\u00a0MU69. \"It's a cold, classical KBO,\" Olkin says. \"What that means is it's primordial, very much a remnant of Solar System formation.\"  Because it is much smaller, MU69 is unlikely to have the glaciers, volcanoes, or oceans that Pluto might have. But it promises to contain more secrets about the Kuiper Belt and the origins of the Solar System.  \"It was a fantastic voyage to the very edge of the Solar System, and we're not done,\" McKinnon says. \"Even though Pluto is the last classical planet, in reality, there's this endless new world to be discovered and explored.\"  _Join over five million\u00a0BBC Earth fans by liking us on\u00a0__Facebook__, or follow us on\u00a0__Twitter__\u00a0and\u00a0__Instagram__._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0__sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter__\u00a0called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

The recipient experiences its agonising effects for the next 12 - 24 hours.  Living in the South American rainforest and growing to around an inch (2.54cm) long, most of us are capable of keeping out of its way.  > Level four you don\u2019t want to know  However entomologist Dr Justin Schmidt has got close enough to this vicious ant in attack mode to rate its sting as the most painful in the world.  He describes the experience as: \u201cPure, intense, brilliant pain. Like walking over flaming charcoal with a three inch nail embedded in your heel.\u201d  Dr Schmidt, from the Southwestern Biological Institute in Arizona, US, is no stranger to the pain inflicted by insects. He reckons he\u2019s been stung more than a thousand times by 150 different species \u2013\u00a0mainly accidentally, but occasionally on purpose.  As the man behind the Schmidt Sting Pain Index \u2013\u00a0which rates the pain caused by the stings of different hymenoptera (a group of insects that includes wasps, bees and ants)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0leaving well alone has never been an option.  It lists pain on a scale from one to four and unsurprisingly the bullet ant tops the charts.    * **Level 4:** _bullet ant, tarantula hawk wasp_   * **Level 3:** _paper wasp, harvester ant_   * **Level 2:** _honey bee, yellow jacket wasp, bald-faced hornet_   * **Level 1.5:**_ bullhorn acacia ant_   * **Level 1:** _fire ant, sweat bee_  \u201cLevel four you don\u2019t want to know,\u201d explains Dr Schmidt.  \u201cThe pain is so immediate and intense that it shuts down all illusions of life as normal. Imagine sticking a finger in a 240 volt electrical socket.\u201d  Rated just beneath the bullet ant for the excruciating, but shorter-lasting nature of its sting is another tiny terror, the tarantula hawk wasp. Females use their venom to paralyse much larger tarantulas to feed to their offspring.  \u201cBlinding, fierce, shockingly electric. A running hair drier has just been dropped into your bubble bath,\u201d is the description given by Dr Schmidt.  The pain inflicted by the humble honey bee\u00a0comes bang in the middle of the scale at a pain level of two.  Dr Schmidt has experienced most of the stings while collecting live nests in the field, but his interest in this form of defence mechanism was first piqued when he was bitten after sitting on an ant hill as a child.  > You probably can make an argument I am crazy, but I enjoy what I do  Since then he has scientifically quantified the pain he has felt through his index, which was first published in the 1980s before being revised in 1990 to include 78 species.  He has also studied the chemistry behind the pain, as well as why and how insects use venom against predators.  \u201cMore pain receives more attention and is therefore a better defence,\u201d Dr Schmidt says.  \u201cAlso it tends to allow bigger aggregations to form, and enabled the evolution of sociality in many groups.  \u201cIt also allowed the use of resources that otherwise would be risky, such as flowers during broad daylight.\u201d  Dr Schmidt is regularly called upon to use his expertise to advise on the ferocity or otherwise of wasps, bees and ants around the world. He is also working on his latest version of the pain index in which he hopes to list many more species.  After more than 30 years on the frontline of his field in stinging insects, Dr Schmidt says there still remains some reportedly fierce species he would like the chance to be hurt by. They include wasps in eastern Peru and tree-living ants in the Congo.  \"I don\u2019t consider myself all that tough,\" he says.  \"Crazy? Well that\u2019s in the eye of the beholder.

They will also feed on the eggs and chicks of defenceless songbirds, a nasty habit that has caused a decline in many familiar species._  **_Reality:_**_ Magpies are not thieves, merely inquisitive. They are interested in objects but show no preference for shininess. It's true that they are voracious predators of songbirds, but there is no evidence that this has resulted in a population crash._  Magpies do not have the best of reputations. There are actually many species of magpie, but most of the rumours centre on Eurasian magpies (_Pica pica_).  In 1815, two French playwrights penned a \"historical melodrama\" called _La Pie Voleuse_, in which a servant is sentenced to death for stealing silverware from her master, when the real thief is his pet magpie. Moved by the Parisian urban myth, Gioachino Rossini set his opera _La gazza ladra_ to the same story. This effectively nailed the magpie's character to the gibbet of popular opinion.  Fast-forward 200 years and researchers subjected magpies to experiments that finally put the thieving stereotype to the test. They gave wild Eurasian magpies two piles of nuts. One was near shiny objects like screws, rings and rectangles of aluminium foil; the other was near the same objects sprayed matte blue.  The birds were distracted from feeding by the presence of objects, but were not obviously drawn to shiny over blue. In two out of 64 tests, a bird did pick up a shiny ring, but quickly discarded it.  \"We can't say that magpies never steal shiny objects,\" says study author Stephen Lea of the University of Exeter in the UK. But \"we currently have no reliable evidence that magpies, more than any other bird, are attracted to shiny objects more than any other object.\"  These findings tally with those of ecologist Tim Birkhead at the University of Sheffield in the UK. He studied magpies in the Rivelin Valley near Sheffield over a ten-year period, and is the author of _The Magpies_.  Birkhead is clear that magpies don't steal. \"There is absolutely no evidence that people have ever found anything silver or shiny in a magpie's nest.\"  However, he says they are very inquisitive birds and do pick up all sorts of things to explore them. So in the past, when people kept magpies as pets \u2013 as in the case of the Parisian melodrama \u2013 there would have been plenty of opportunities for birds to pick up objects of value. That could explain the rumours of kleptomania.  Is there any truth that magpies savage other birds? \"There is absolutely no doubt they eat songbird eggs and chicks,\" says Birkhead.  The magpie is a persistent, noisy and conspicuous predator, he says. So if you've been watching the happy courtship of a pair of blackbirds in your garden, you will be understandably upset when a magpie flays their chicks on your lawn.  But there is little evidence that the magpies' predations have resulted in a decline in songbirds.  In a study published in 1991, Birkhead and his colleagues examined the population densities and breeding successes of magpies and fifteen species of British songbirds, including blackbirds, blue tits, song thrushes, dunnocks and robins.  Between 1966 and 1986, the number of magpies in Britain increased steadily by around 5% per year. But this had no obvious effect on the nesting success of any of the songbird species in the study.  In fact, the number of songbirds in woodland increased most when the number of magpies in the vicinity was at its greatest, suggesting that any decline in songbird numbers probably had more to do with habitat quality than magpies. A study published in 1998, based on an even longer span of data, reached similar conclusions.  Pet cats are a far bigger problem. \"Cats are undoubtedly a monumental threat to songbirds, but it's magpies that incur the wrath of the average bird lover,\" says Birkhead.  So magpies are misunderstood. \"If magpies were rare, people would travel a long way to see them,\" says Birkhead. \"In bright sunlight they are the most exquisitely beautiful birds, with that lovely long tail and iridescence.\"  But, he acknowledges, most people are still going to see magpies as a nefarious creature. \"There is very little chance of persuading the public otherwise.\"  **Tweetable truths about magpies**  Magpies will pick up objects and study them, but they are not thieves  The stereotype of the thieving magpie was restated in the 1963 Tintin adventure _The Castafiore Emerald_.

The project's 80 volunteers have set up an online catalogue containing 3,500 personnel records of the city's civil defence workers.  People wanting to find out further details of life in the city during the war, when it suffered some of the heaviest bombing in Britain, can use it to direct them to more detailed records at the Hull History Centre.  The full archive covers the civil defence personnel cards as well as war damage records, gallantry awards and victory celebrations.  Bombing raids killed and seriously injured thousands of Hull's inhabitants during 1939-45, with hardly a house undamaged in the city.  It suffered the country's first daylight raid of the war in June 1940 and the last daylight land raid towards the end of the war in March 1945.  ## Heaviest raids  The majority of air raids on the city took place during 1940 and 1941.  During the heaviest raids on 7/8 May and 8/9 May 1941, more than 200 people were killed each night.  Hull suffered numerous air raids because it was a port, easy to find, and German aircraft flew over it to other targets such as Sheffield, Liverpool or Manchester.  Local historian Alan Brigham said: \"The Humber estuary and the River Hull made the city a very easy target to navigate to and planes could be back over water in minutes.\"  The authorities were seriously concerned about the effect of heavy bombing on the civilian population, but Hull did not crack and the raids produced many examples of heroism.  Victoria Oxberry, the project's archivist, said the records contained extraordinary detail.  There are more than 200 files from the city engineer about air raid shelters, including three files about the shelters' sanitary arrangements.  Miss Oxberry has also been moved by the personal stories contained in the records.  ## Defending the city  She highlighted the story of Thomas Richard Gale of Escourt Street, Hull, who crawled into a \"severely demolished\" house in Carden Avenue, to rescue a woman and two children during 1943.  Despite the state of the bombed house, rescuers thought they could hear voices.

But their insistence on eating bamboo is dumb and they are rubbish at sex, so they deserve to go extinct. Except, of course, those proficient in kung fu. _  **_Reality:_**_ They are cute, for sure. But don't go in for a cuddle; pandas can deliver one heck of a bite. Eating bamboo is a blinding evolutionary strategy. They have an intense and productive sex drive. They do not deserve to go extinct._  There is a lot of confusion about giant pandas, possibly more than any other species alive. This is because of the absolutely massive symbolic, political and economic baggage that is heaped on captive pandas. This burden far outweighs what we really know about this species in the wild.  > Take a deep breath and purge your mind of everything you think you know about giant pandas  This division between captive and wild pandas is important. Because the truth about pandas depends on which kind of panda you're talking about.  If it's the captive panda you are interested in, then the fluffy, sneezing, clownish, reproductively-inept stereotype stands.  But if it's the truth about wild pandas you're after, then you need to shut down the panda-cam, take a deep breath and purge your mind of everything you think you know about giant pandas. Most of it is wrong.  What is undeniably true is that pandas are striking animals. In 1966, the zoologist Desmond Morris put forward 20 factors to explain the human obsession with pandas. About half of them were to do with appearance: flat face, large eyes, soft appearance, rounded outline, contrasting colours and so on.  > A panda can deliver one of the highest bite forces of any carnivore  But appearances can be deceptive and it would be a mistake to get too close to a wild panda.  Even in captivity, where pandas are used to being cooed over by humans, they can be dangerous. In 2006, a drunken 28-year-old man by the name of Zhang clambered into the panda enclosure at Beijing Zoo and tried to pet the internee. He'd been showing off to his companion, but all he had to show for his exploits was a right calf savaged beyond recognition. There are photos here, but they are very, very ugly. You've been warned.  Such injuries are possible because of the giant panda's incredibly chunky skull and Mohican-like sagittal crest. This is the anchor point for a massive chewing muscle that can deliver one of the highest bite forces of any carnivore. The panda needs this impressive bite if it is to crack its way into the tough sheath of a bamboo stem.  The panda also boasts an enlarged radial sesamoid bone or \"false-thumb\" to get a grip as it munches, a complex suite of gut microbes to help its digestion, and a readiness to spend more than half its life collecting, preparing and eating bamboo.  With adaptations like these, the giant panda has performed a remarkable evolutionary switcheroo. It is a carnivore that has found a way to eat bamboo, a food source that is pretty dependable from one season to the next. Even better, unlike the prey of most carnivores, bamboo is not in the habit of running away.  But it is on the subject of sex where the reputation of captive pandas is at greatest odds with the reality in the wild.  Giant pandas have a peculiar reproductive cycle, with adult females becoming fertile just once a year for less than two days.  With such an unusual arrangement, it is inevitable that pandas struggle to breed in captivity. So humans often intervene, imagining that \"panda porn\" might spark some randiness, or resorting to rectal probes to trigger an ejaculation. But to smirk at the diminutive size of the male panda's winkie, to mock the female panda for being frigid and to propose the species only has itself to blame for its endangered status is nothing short of biological ignorance.  We humans have only been studying giant pandas in the wild since 1980 and we still have so much to learn. But from what we can tell, pandas do sex very, very differently in the wild.  It was the legendary zoologist George Schaller who made some of the first observations of real, wild panda sex. In 1981, he'd been tracking a female called Zhen-Zhen, as were two male pandas \u2013 one large, one small. \"The small male comes near, moaning, and is promptly attacked again, though I only hear growls, roars, and whines like a pack of dogs fighting and see the bamboo shake violently,\" he wrote in _The Giant Pandas of Wolong_.  > This species has been around for some 20 million years  It turns out that threesome or more-somes are pretty standard for giant pandas in the wild, an arrangement that would be hard to replicate in any zoo. In just over three hours, Schaller recorded the large male mating with Zhen-Zhen at least 48 times, roughly once every three minutes. This is way more sex than most humans get in a year.  This intensity and frequency of sexual congress may account for the observation that pandas are so much more productive in the wild than they are in captivity. A long-term study of radio-collared pandas in the Qingling Mountains in Shaanxi Province revealed that females reliably give birth every other year and 60% of cubs survive to see in their first birthday. \"On the basis of its reproductive potential, the giant panda therefore remains an evolutionarily successful species,\" wrote zoologist Pan Wenshi and his colleagues in 2004.  If you are still clinging to the panda-bad-sex stereotype, there is one more truth about pandas that you need to digest. This species, in one shape or form, has been around for some 20 million years. That, boys and girls, is the definition of good at sex.  **Tweetable truths about giant pandas**  **Tweet:** The giant panda delivers one of the highest bite forces of any carnivore  **Tweet:** The giant panda spends around 55% of its life collecting, preparing and eating bamboo  **Tweet:** In the wild, giant panda sex usually involves one female and two or more males  **Tweet:** In the wild, a female panda may mate over 50 times in a matter of hours, more than most humans get in a year", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The truth about giant pandas", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150310-the-truth-about-giant-pandas", "countriesMentioned": ["United States"], "author": "Henry Nicholls"},{"newsText": "**_Reputation:_**_ It's so cute the way meerkats stand on their hind legs. They live in large, caring, harmonious groups. They love eating scorpions. They are always fighting cobras. _  **_Reality:_**_ Meerkats spend most of their time on all fours. They do eat scorpions, but not as often as TV makes out. Group-living isn't always as congenial as it would seem. Meerkats have a dark side and females will sometimes end up killing babies. Confrontations with cobras are rare._  Twenty years ago, I spent nine months walking with meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. I was one of the first graduate volunteers on the long-running Kalahari Meerkat Project. I remember having to pull a stuffed caracal \u2013 a sleek, lynx-like cat \u2013 towards different groups of meerkats, with the aim of figuring out how they perceive and communicate different levels of threat.  > It's at this time of day that they look most like little people  Meerkat groups range from 3 to 50 individuals. They usually comprise a dominant pair; a few other non-breeding adults; a rabble of juveniles, often from several reproductive events; and a cluster of impossibly cute pups. At dawn, a group will emerge from its overnight den and before heading off for the day's foraging, the meerkats must take several minutes to warm up on the top of their burrow.  The vertical posture they adopt \u2013 sometimes resting on their haunches, sometimes standing, with their tail acting like the third leg of a tripod \u2013 offers the greatest surface area to the rising sun. It also makes for terrific photos: the lighting is great and the animals don't move much.  But the real reason that we see so many images of sunning meerkats is their anthropogenic posture. It's at this time of day that they look most like little people.  For most of their waking lives, however, meerkats are on all fours in search of food.  \"Meerkats are always digging,\" says Marta Manser of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. She has worked on the Kalahari Meerkat Project for more than 20 years and was the researcher I helped with the caracal experiment in the 1990s. \"None of the other mongoose species invests as much time in digging.\"  A foraging meerkat will occasionally come across the entrance to a scorpion burrow and have a go at digging it out, but scorpions are not the staple that most TV documentaries would have us believe. In a thorough study of meerkat diet and foraging behaviour in the 1980s, some 80% of all food items were tiny insects \u2013 mostly beetle larvae and adults \u2013 whilst only 2% were scorpions.  When they are foraging, one of the meerkats \u2013 often the dominant male or female \u2013 will forego food for extended periods. It climbs to a position of prominence, which can be a researcher's head, to keep a lookout for predators.  > Meerkats don't appear to have actual \"words\" for specific predators  Over the years, Manser's research \u2013 recording meerkat calls, studying their acoustic structure, and observing the reaction to carefully-controlled playbacks \u2013 has revealed how a meerkat tells the rest of the group about approaching danger.  There are two main categories of call: one for ground-based threats like a caracal or black-backed jackal, and another for aerial threats like eagles. Although meerkats don't appear to have actual \"words\" for specific predators, they do inject their alarm calls with a level of urgency.  \"If you combine these streams of information, it could in theory be enough to communicate the exact species in question,\" says Manser. It would take a human several words to convey the presence of a martial eagle at a distance of 500m. It has not yet been demonstrated experimentally, but a meerkat may be able to transmit all this information in a single, urgent bark, she says.  In 2012, Manser hit upon a brilliantly simple experiment to test whether meerkat calls communicate the identity of the caller. Having identified a meerkat for the experiment, she and her colleagues simultaneously played it calls recorded from one individual but from two different places. \"They notice the contradiction,\" says Manser.  A study the following year demonstrated that this kind of individual recognition is particularly relevant when it comes to the balance of power between females. For instance, when the dominant female is pregnant, playbacks of her call are quick to trigger submissive behaviour amongst subordinate females. If the dominant female is not pregnant, or the call comes from any other individual, the subordinates simply aren't bothered.  This touches on another truth about meerkats, one that sits a little uncomfortably with the caring, sharing stereotype. When the reproductive hierarchy is clear, meerkat society is amiable enough. But when the hierarchy breaks down, says Manser, \"meerkats aren't quite so cute.\"  In particular, woe betide any subordinate female that has the temerity to fall pregnant and give birth. Her offspring will often be killed.  > In every one of these episodes, the offender ended the life of a close relative  The first publication to describe infanticide in meerkats in detail, published in 1998, reported on six cases that had been observed directly in the course of five years. Warning: the following excerpt from the research paper reveals a dark side to meerkats that some readers \u2013 particularly those wedded to the cutesey cliche \u2013 may find distressing.  \"In all these cases, female group members carried pups out of a breeding burrow where they had been born less than 24 h earlier and killed and/or ate them in the presence of an observer.\"  In every one of these episodes, the murderous and/or cannibalistic offender ended the life of a close relative: a nephew, niece, sibling, cousin and, on one occasion, a daughter.  In addition, there were several instances where pups were dispatched by rampaging meerkats from a neighbouring group.  > This infanticidal behaviour might be crucial for maintaining the stability of the group  More disturbingly still, the researchers concluded there is probably a whole lot more infanticide that goes undetected below ground. It would be the obvious explanation for the fact that the pups of a subordinate are far less likely to emerge from the birthing den than those of a dominant.  As brutal as this infanticidal behaviour might be, it's probably crucial for maintaining the stability of the group, and hence boosting each meerkat's chances of survival.  And what about those feisty confrontations between meerkats and cape cobras? \"I have probably seen it about 3 times in 20 years,\" says Manser. But it's a whole lot more common when there's a documentary to be made. \"The film teams bring in a person with a snake,\" she says.  **Tweetable truths about meerkats**  **Tweet:** A meerkat can probably say \"There's a martial eagle incoming at 500m!\" in a single, urgent bark  **Tweet:** When a meerkat is foraging, only 1 in 50 food items is a scorpion  **Tweet:** Meerkats can tell the identity of other individuals from their calls", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Earth - The truth about meerkats", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150324-the-truth-about-meerkats", "countriesMentioned": ["Switzerland", "United States"], "author": "Henry Nicholls"},{"newsText": "![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p058y6vc.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionWork is continuing on the interior of the plane  A restored World War II Spitfire that saw service in the Battle of Britain has gone on public show in Dumfries.  The plane was salvaged from the bottom of Loch Doon in Ayrshire in 1982 after a four-year search by divers.  It crashed during a training flight from Ayr in 1941, killing the Czech pilot.  Returning the bodywork to its former glory has taken 35 years of work and involved several false starts before being carried out.  However, the Spitfire is finally ready to take pride of place at Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum whose founders first commissioned the salvage project way back in 1977.  Image caption David Reid said there was still work to do to the interior of the plane  Chairman David Reid said it was a fantastic addition to their collection.  \"When we first started, most of the bits and pieces we were recovering then were coming from wartime crash sites and this one looked a peach,\" he explained.  \"We contacted the local diving club in 1977, just after the museum opened in the July, and they agreed to take on the task of looking for this.  \"We were expecting them to find it the first weekend - they found a syrup tin.\"  However, the search continued for four years with \"countless hours of diving\".  \"They finally found it in 1982, probably just by feel, because the silt at the bottom of Loch Doon is several feet deep,\" said Mr Reid.  \"They actually bumped into to it, I think the engine was the first part they found.\"  That was just the start of another long journey towards its restoration.  A Yorkshire-based expert was able to finish the fuselage but could not work on the wings due to ill health.  Eventually the museum secured some funding to buy a set of wings and the plane has finally been able to go on show.  \"If you ask anybody in the UK or probably worldwide to name the most famous World War II aircraft - depending on which side you were on, it is almost certainly going to be a Spitfire,\" said Mr Reid.  \"It was the greatest World War II fighter, really.\"  Although the exterior of the plane has been largely completed there is still a significant amount of work to do to the interior.  Nonetheless, the museum is optimistic that it can be carried out in the not too distant future.  \"Hopefully within the next couple of years we will be able to let people actually sit in a genuine Battle of Britain survivor,\" said Mr Reid.", "newsHeadline": "Loch Doon Spitfire goes on display in Dumfries - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-40599724", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States", "Australia", "Canada"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Aircraft from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight are flown in an air display to mark the Flight's 60th Anniversary at RAF Coningsby](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1530E/production/_96889768_mediaitem96889767.jpg) Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prince William was among the spectators for a display marking the 60th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight  The Duke of Cambridge has attended an air display marking 60 years of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.

Speaking at the time, Flt Lt Dunlop said it was very frustrating.  \"These historic aircraft are happiest in the air and that's where we want them to be - as a living memorial to the crews who flew them,\" he said.  Following the incident, the Lancaster was also excluded from VE Day commemorations.

The Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, who is patron of the flight, will also be in attendance.  More than 7,300 Lancasters were built during World War Two but most were scrapped in the years after 1945.

While 22,500 Spitfires were originally built, just 56 are still airworthy, and most of these are later versions of the aircraft. There are only four Mark 1s still flying.  Christie's Nic McElhatton says interest in the aircraft has been incredible: \"The plane we're selling is very special.\"  The aircraft is expected to fetch up to \u00a32.5m ($3.9m) but could easily go for more. \"We've had a number of clients who've expressed serious interest. Anything is possible,\" says Nic.  The sale on 9 July has thrown the spotlight on Britain's burgeoning vintage aviation restoration scene. Air displays are increasingly popular - the demand to see examples of rare and often unique aircraft seems never to have been higher.  Image copyright Christie's Image caption The black and white paint underside scheme was used to identify RAF planes from the ground but was abandoned in June 1940 and replaced with duck egg blue  There are now around 80 air shows a year in the UK from small locally-run events to big displays such as the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford and Flying Legends at Duxford, Cambridgeshire, which specialises in piston- engined aircraft, mainly from World War Two.  \"People do make really significant journeys from all over the world,\" says Jane Larcombe of The Fighter Collection, that runs Flying Legends.  \"There is a very big industry in the UK, building World War One and World War Two aircraft,\" says aviation historian Andy Saunders.  \"Hidden away all round the country there are craftsmen, beavering away building remarkable aeroplanes.\"  Back in May 1940, Spitfire P9374 was being flown by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove when he was shot-down. Successfully crash-landing on Calais beach he radioed: \"Tell mother I'll be home for tea.\"  Sadly getting back home for tea took longer than he hoped. He was captured and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner. His Spitfire sank into the sands and was forgotten about.  ## 'This thin red line'  Then in 1980, winds and tides uncovered it again. Andy Saunders remembers getting an unexpected call from the manager of Calais hover port.  \"He telephoned me out of the blue and I thought it was complete rubbish. But then he sent me the photos to prove it - it was pretty much intact when it emerged from the sand.\"  After languishing in storage, it was eventually bought by US billionaire and philanthropist Thomas Kaplan.  \"I have always been a student of military history, it was a great passion from an early age - and in particular aviation history and the Battle of Britain,\" he says.  Image copyright Christie's Image caption Despite 40 years on a beach, parts of the original engine were re-used, combined with another Merlin III engine  Image caption Mark 1 Spitfires used a three-blade metal de Havilland or Rotol propeller. None could be found, so a set of eight were made at a cost of \"several hundred thousand pounds\"  Image caption New tyres had to be made as well. This aircraft has smooth Dunlop tyres not used on later Spitfires  More pictures: rebuilding a Spitfire step-by-step  Image caption The yellow diamond of reactive paint on the wing was supposed to give early warning of a gas attack by turning black  When he found the wrecks of two Mark 1 Spitfires, he decided to restore them both to flight - and to exactly as they had been when they crashed - with no compromises.  One was Peter Cazenove's Spitfire that is now being auctioned for the RAF Benevolent Fund and the big cat charity, Panthera.  The other was flown by Geoffrey Stephenson, the commanding officer of 19 Squadron - based at Duxford - the first unit to be equipped with Spitfires.  Mr Kaplan is giving this second plane to the aviation branch of the Imperial War Museum, which is now based at the same airfield.  \"For me it is a thank you to the UK - this thin red line separating us from barbarism - at a time when the United States was not in the war.\"  * * *  ## Battle of Britain: Myths and reality  Image copyright Battle of Britain Memorial Trust Image caption Pilots scramble for their Hurricanes. The less-glamorous Hurricane equipped two-thirds of squadrons and shot down more German planes than the Spitfire during 1940.  In 1940 it seemed that after the British army's evacuation from Dunkirk, and the fall of France, all that stood in the way of a German invasion was the RAF.  The Spitfire, designed by RJ Mitchell of Supermarine even as he was dying of cancer, came into frontline service just in time.  Intense air battles raged as the German air force, the Luftwaffe, tried to defeat the RAF as precursor to a possible landing.  Eventually the Luftwaffe gave up and Hitler turned his attention towards Russia. So how close did Britain come to defeat?  In popular myth, the RAF airfields were only spared because the Germans suddenly stopped bombing them and started attacking London instead.  Yet historian Stephen Bungay, author of The Most Dangerous Enemy, says in reality the Germans never came close to victory. The Luftwaffe was not trained for the low-level, hit-and-run attacks which might have worn down Britain's defences.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Battle of Britain casualties: The RAF had 537 airmen killed and lost 1,012 aircraft. The Luftwaffe had 2,662 airmen killed and lost 1,918 aircraft  \"We were out-producing Germany in fighters by more than two-to-one, and we had a repair organisation that was turning around damaged fighters faster than they were.\"  RAF Fighter Command's strength actually grew during the battle, and even had it been defeated, the German invasion fleet would have had to get past the Royal Navy.  The true significance of the battle, says Stephen Bungay, is that it ensured Britain stayed in the war and helped shape the peace.  \"If we'd gone out in 1940, the war would have been fought between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union - and the Red Army would have likely won.  \"Europe would have become part of a Soviet-dominated East, with Britain a marginalised satellite state and the US having far less influence and power in the world than it did.\"  BBC History: Find out more about the Battle of Britain  BBC iWonder: Why do we love the Spitfire?  * * *  ## Lengthy restoration  Both of Thomas Kaplan's Spitfires ended up at one of Europe's biggest aviation restoration specialists, The Aircraft Restoration Company (ARC) at Duxford.  The hardest challenge was working out exactly what a Mark 1 Spitfire looked like, as records weren't often kept, says ARC engineer Martin Overall.  \"They changed so rapidly and you'd find aircraft three or four months older that were completely different, because they'd been modified just to keep pace with German development.  Image caption During the war Spitfires were mass-produced but in restoration projects like this they are now hand-built  \"We investigated several crash sites and gained a snapshot of what the aircraft would have been like.\"  It took 12 engineers three years to restore it at a cost of several millions, though exactly how much nobody will say - but eventually Spitfire P9374 flew again.  \"It was just a breath-taking moment,\" says Andy Saunders.  \"Having seen the wreck when it came off the beach, I never dreamed it would be recreated and fly.\"  Besides restoring Spitfires, ARC regularly works on up to eight major restoration projects for clients. Manager John Romain says companies like his are helping preserve vital engineering skills.  \"There's a lot of old skill-sets in our industry, from sheet metalworkers to the electricians. There's a lot of interest in working with us now, so we have our own apprenticeship scheme which gives us our engineers of the future.\"  ## Restoration to re-manufacturing  ARC is not the only company in the business. In Sussex a team of engineers at Retrotec specialise in restoring biplanes.  Over the past 28 years, the firm has restored a string of rare World War One and 1930s era aircraft.  \"We started off maintaining old aircraft, moved to restoration and repair, and now we are basically re-manufacturing aircraft,\" says owner Guy Black.  \"The silver biplanes of the Thirties are a very romantic and important stage of aircraft development.  \"They are also extremely beautiful aircraft, representing an era that will probably never happen again.\"  Image copyright Retrotec Image caption Two Hawker Nimrods, both restored by Retrotec. This was a naval fighter designed to operate from aircraft carriers  Image caption Guy Black (pictured right) checks out a Le Rhone engine on a Sopwith Pup fuselage  Silver machines - step inside a modern biplane factory  Image caption Found in an elephant stable in India, the hope is that this World War One DH9 bomber will fly again this year  The company is now in effect an aircraft manufacturer in miniature: in its workshops its engineers carry out design work, metal work, airframe manufacturing, engine rebuilds, as well as woodwork and fabric covering.  Currently Guy's team is working on a World War One DH9 bomber, one of a pair were in an elephant stables in India and brought back to the UK for restoration.  Nobody's ever restored such a plane to flight before, and Retrotec hopes to have it flying this year.  But when it comes to the aircraft engineers of the future, he says the lack of training in schools is a concern.  \"There is very little training in practical engineering or practical woodwork,\" says Mr Black. \"There seems to be a drive to ensure everyone has a degree in engineering, but there's very few people interested in doing hands- on work.\"  ## Spitfire handover  Back at Duxford, Thomas Kaplan plans to officially hand over Geoffrey Stephenson's Spitfire to the Imperial War Museum on 9 July, and then head down to London to watch Peter Cazenove's aircraft being auctioned off.  \"To me it is all about 'The Few' who stood up and said - this is the line beyond which we won't be pushed.\"  Rightly or wrongly the Spitfire, thank perhaps to those elliptical wings, easily outshines many other aircraft in people's affections.  Says Christie's Nic McElhatton: \"You look at the silhouette of a Spitfire and you recognize it instantly.  \"It's timeless, it is the most perfect piece of engineering - a work of art.\"", "newsHeadline": "What does it take to restore a World War Two Spitfire? - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32935757", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "British Indian Ocean Territory", "Russian Federation", "France", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Eurofighter Typhoon painted in Battle of Britain colours](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/83142000/jpg/_83142189_83146809.jpg) Image copyright MOD Image caption The painted Eurofighter Typhoon will fly at a number of events during the summer  A specially painted Eurofighter Typhoon commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been unveiled.

It also bears a red devil emblem in honour of the only RAF Fighter Command pilot awarded a Victoria Cross in the conflict.  It was revealed during a ceremony at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire.  The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF.

During the unveiling ceremony, Wing Commander James Heald from RAF Coningsby, said: \"What we've tried to do is recreate the paint job of the Hurricane flown by Flt Lt James Nicolson, who was the only Victoria Cross winner of the Battle of Britain.  \"He was damaged and wounded and was in the process of bailing out when an enemy aircraft appeared in front of him,\" he said.  \"So he climbed back in - shot down the enemy aircraft - then continued with his bail out.\"  Image copyright MOD Image caption The Typhoon's colour scheme matches that used by the RAF at the time of the Battle of Britain  Image copyright MOD Image caption Flt Lt James Nicolson's Hurricane featured a red devil emblem on its port side  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It is estimated that between 10 July and the end of October 1940, the RAF lost around 1,023 aircraft whilst the Luftwaffe lost 1,887  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Luftwaffe's principal fighter planes were the Messerschmitt Bf109 and the Messerschmitt Bf110  The commemorative Typhoon will fly alongside a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire at air shows during the summer.

The department is the largest in the BBC in terms of staff, with more than 8,500 people around the UK and the rest of the world.  BBC News incorporates network news (the newsroom, news programmes such as Newsnight and Newsbeat, political programmes such as the Daily Politics, and the weather team), English Regions and Global News.  Material is brought into the BBC by its newsgathering staff, one of the largest operations of its kind in the world, with more than 40 international bureaux and seven in the UK.  It is transmitted to audiences on an increasingly diverse range of platforms including tablet computers and mobile phones.  ## New Broadcasting House  \u2022 New BH has 12 floors (nine above and three below ground level)  \u2022 The area of all floors in the building is equivalent to 10 football pitches.  \u2022 It has 15 lifts giving a travel distance of nearly half a mile  \u2022 It has the biggest floating floor studio in the world  \u2022 NBH has five TV studios  \u2022 The double-height newsroom could accommodate 90 London buses  \u2022 The curved glass facade used 2,000 sq m of glazing  \u2022 NBH uses 10,000 miles of cable  ## NETWORK NEWSROOM  The 24-hour newsroom is responsible for the One, Six and Ten O'Clock bulletins, the BBC News channel, radio bulletins and summaries, BBC World, the World Service and the BBC News website.  Since 2013, nearly all this output has been produced and transmitted from the new wing of Broadcasting House (NBH) at the north end of Regent Street in central London.  It is tucked behind the original Art Deco building that was opened as the BBC's first purpose-built headquarters in 1932.  NBH is occupied by 3,000 journalists and production staff in the news division. At the heart of the building, occupying the basement and ground floors, is the multimedia newsroom, the biggest in Europe, which brings together all the BBC's network and global news production for the first time.  From here, BBC journalists, many of them specialists, deliver high-quality audio, visual and text accounts of breaking news and significant events with merged teams and shared content to meet the world's appetite for on-demand news.  ## NEWS IN SALFORD  BBC Breakfast and Radio 5 live are broadcast from MediaCity UK, in Salford Quays, approximately two miles from Manchester city centre.  Radio 5 live news employs about 130 journalists who produce some 75% of the network's output, or about 130 hours a week.  ## NEWS PROGRAMMES  The BBC has many major daily and weekly current affairs programmes, investigative journalism and major interview programmes, including Panorama, Today and Newsnight. It also provides services focused on distinctive audiences, including BBC World Service news programmes such as Newshour and BBC Radio 1 news programmes such as Newsbeat. This is the home of much of the BBC's original journalism and material is shared across news outlets to enrich content for as many audiences as possible.  ## POLITICAL PROGRAMMES  The BBC's political output is based within a stone's throw of the Palace of Westminster, from where it reports on the decisions and activities of the UK government, MPs and peers.  It makes and broadcasts programmes such as Today (and Yesterday) in Parliament on Radio 4, and BBC Two's Daily and Sunday Politics as well as the BBC Parliament TV channel. It also provides a huge amount of material for BBC network TV and radio outlets, the BBC News website and regional TV and local radio.  Elections - local, general and European - are covered by BBC Westminster. The political research unit provides background information and reliable statistics on parties, policies and polling, producing indispensable election guides which are studied and treasured by politics geeks and other staff across the corporation.  ## NEWSGATHERING  \"Where do you get the news from?\" is a question frequently asked by audiences and the answer is, for the most part, BBC newsgathering. Some news is scheduled and planners and staff, known as news organisers, are able to deploy in advance correspondents, producers, camera crews, and on occasion, the BBC helicopter. Even with advanced warning, meeting the demands of all the BBC outlets can present a challenge for reporters, who might face requests for a two-way - or live interview - in the first minutes of the Today programme just after 06:00, frequent appearances on the News Channel and network radio throughout the day, a piece for the website and a package for the Ten O'Clock TV bulletin, with an update for The World Tonight.  Newsgathering, home and foreign, must also respond to unpredictable events such as murders, floods, transport crashes, earthquakes and wars and rumours of wars. It can be a dangerous calling. Foreign correspondents, producers, camera crews, fixers and translators frequently risk their lives to draw attention to the history of the world as it unfolds.  ## GLOBAL NEWS  BBC Global News includes the BBC World Service, BBC World News television, bbc.com/news (the BBC's international-facing news site) and BBC Monitoring. The BBC's international news services attract a global audience of 239 million in more than 200 countries and territories. Together they represent the voice and face of the corporation to the rest of the world. BBC Global is increasingly working with partners to build audiences across the United States, Asia and Africa.  ## AROUND THE UK  BBC English Regions, part of the BBC News Group, is made up of 3,000 staff based from the Channel Islands in the south to the border with Scotland in the north. It is split into 12 regions, each broadcasting regional news programmes throughout the day along with weekly politics, current affairs and sport shows from their regional centres. Each region has up to six local radio stations and up to six BBC local websites. There are also teams working in bureaux in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales to provide programming for their own national audiences as well as contributing to network news. The BBC's 40 local radio stations reach more than seven million listeners across the UK.  ## WEATHER  The BBC weather centre produces forecasts for TV, radio, online, mobile and Red Button, in partnership with the Met Office. The BBC weather presenters are all trained broadcast meteorologists.  ## THE FUTURE  As well as the challenge of producing daily and weekly output, a small number of BBC journalists, engineers and technologists focus on creating new ways of covering and delivering the news. The Operations team in Newsgathering focus on audio, video and text from the BBC's correspondents on location, while BBC News Labs leads innovation in digital news.", "newsHeadline": "This is BBC News - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/19888761", "countriesMentioned": ["Central African Republic", "United Kingdom", "Greece", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa", "Brazil"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "## What are News Feeds?

The company has clients including museums and private customers.  Image copyright Retrotec Image caption \"We only do aeroplanes that no one else wants to do!\" says Retrotec's Guy Black.

This is the fuselage and engine of a World War One Sopwith Pup  Image caption The firm employs 20 people: \"I find it especially important to take on apprentices, because there is a very small pool of qualified engineers in our particular trade\"  Image caption By far the biggest challenge is finding plans and drawings, many of which were thrown away or destroyed  Image caption There is a surprising amount of metalwork in early aeroplanes, When wrecks come in some of this can be re-used, but all the wooden parts have to be newly manufactured  Image caption A .303 inch Vickers machine gun for a Sopwith Pup being built for a Retrotec customer.

The video of the monk, now known by his pre-monk name, Wirapol Sukphol, went viral after being posted on YouTube in 2013.  A subsequent investigation by the Thai Department of Special Investigations (DSI) uncovered a lifestyle of what appeared to be mind-blowing decadence. They tracked down at least 200 million Thai baht ($6m; \u00a34.6m) in ten bank accounts, and the purchase of 22 Mercedes Benz cars.  Wirapol had built a mansion in southern California, owned a large and gaudily- decorated house in his home town of Ubon Ratchathani, and had also constructed a giant replica of the famous Emerald Buddha statue in Bangkok's royal palace, which he claimed - falsely, as it turned out - contained nine tonnes of gold.  There was evidence, too, the DSI said, of sexual relationships with a number of women. One woman claimed he had fathered a child with her when she was only 15 years old, a claim the DSI says is supported by DNA analysis.  Wirapol fled to the US. It took four years for the Thai authorities to secure his extradition. He has denied criminal charges of fraud, money laundering and rape.  ## Monks behaving badly  How had a monk acquired so much influence, even in his early twenties? How was he allowed to behave in ways which clearly violate the patimokkha (the 227 precepts by which monks are supposed to live)? Monks are not even supposed to touch money, and sex is strictly off-limits.  Monks behaving badly are nothing new in Thailand. The temptations of modern life have thrown up many examples of monks with unseemly wealth, monks taking drugs, dancing, enjoying sexual relations with men, women, girls and boys.  There are also temples which have attracted large and dedicated followings, through skilful promotion of charismatic monks and abbots, said to have supernatural powers.  These have capitalised on two aspects of modern Thai life; the yearning for spiritual succour among urban Thais, who no longer have a close relationship with a traditional village temple, and a belief that donating generously to powerful temples will bring success and more material wealth.  It appears Wirapol tapped into this trend. He arrived in the poor North Eastern province of Sisaket in the early 2000s, establishing a monastery on donated land in the village of Ban Yang. But according to the sub-district head, Ittipol Nontha, few local people went to his temple, because they were too poor to offer the kind of donations he expected.  Image copyright DSI Image caption Wirapol was questioned as part of an investigation by the DSI  The monk started holding elaborate ceremonies, he said, selling amulets, and built his replica of the Emerald Buddha, to attract wealthier devotees from other parts of the country.  These followers have described being beguiled by his soft, warm voice, and convinced by his claim to have powers - like the ability to walk on water and talk to deities. In turn, Wirapol gave generously to those with influence in the province; many of the cars he bought were gifts for important monks and officials.  Even today he still has supporters, who argue he is at heart a good man, entitled to enjoy donated luxuries.  ## Plagued by scandals  After a succession of scandals, people are openly talking about a crisis of Buddhism in Thailand. Numbers of ordained monks have been falling steeply in recent years, and many smaller village temples are unable to support themselves financially.  The body which is supposed to govern the Buddhist clergy is the Supreme Sangha Council, but this comprises a group of very elderly monks, and until this year had not had a properly functioning Supreme Patriarch for more than a decade. It has proved ineffective.  The National Office of Buddhism is also supposed to regulate the religion, but it too has been plagued by leadership turmoil and allegations of financial irregularities.  The government has now introduced a law requiring temples, which collectively accumulate $3-4bn (\u00a32-3bn) in donations every year, to publicise their financial records. It is also talking about introducing a new, digital ID card for monks to ensure those tainted by malpractice cannot be ordained again.  The faltering morality of monks, though, is partly rooted in the way Buddhism has evolved in Thailand.  For 150 years there have been two quite different forms of Buddhism; that of the more austere, Thammayut tradition, practised in the elite, palace-backed temples of Bangkok, which upholds the strict rules about monks detaching themselves from the material world; and the looser Mahanikai tradition of the provinces, where monks are part of the community, joining neighbourhood activities, sometimes in violation of the patimokkhai.  In the villages, temples have served as schools or traditional centres of medicine and venues for local celebrations. The advice of monks has been sought on a range of worldly issues; in this environment the line between what is and is not acceptable behaviour can become blurred.  ## 'Building cases against themselves'  The other source of the problem is the hold that superstition has over many Thais, and the way this has become commercialised.  Monks are these days often used more as deliverers of semi-religious rituals - like blessing new cars or houses for good luck - than practitioners of the 227 precepts. No-one in Thailand bats an eyelid at the sight of lottery tickets being sold inside temples.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Buddhist monks are not supposed to touch money, and sex is strictly off-limits  This love of superstition extends to rich Thais, who are happy to donate generously in the belief this will ensure greater fortune in the future.  Phra Payom Kalayano, the abbot of a temple north of Bangkok well known for his criticism of the commercialisation of Buddhism, has appealed to Thais to be more thoughtful about donating.  \"Nowadays people think good karma is about throwing money at temples - especially rich people. They have faith, but they don't think. That is not practising good karma, smartly. That is just blind faith.  \"At the same time, some monks are stupid. They don't know how to manage the donations they receive. Instead of managing the money to build karma and prestige for the temple, the monks end up building criminal cases against themselves,\" he said.  In a simpler age, before the arrival of globalisation and its many consumer distractions, it was easier to advocate a monastic life that disavows all material pleasures. But it is harder today to insist that monks should forego technological conveniences like smartphones and air travel.  It is even harder to define what role monks should play in 21st Century Thailand, beyond the provision of services like amulets and good luck blessings, which can so easily turn into a money-making business.", "newsHeadline": "Thailand monks: Wirapol Sukphol case highlights country's Buddhism crisis - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40678511", "countriesMentioned": ["Thailand", "United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Marian Hill](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10C2D/production/_97035686_marianhill.jpg) Image copyright Republic Records Image caption Marian Hill wrote their breakout song, Down, in the space of one night  It's an ordinary day in Advert-ville, USA.  As the black-and-white sun rises over a black-and-white street, authentic- looking extras with a variety of contemporary hairstyles walk past a dilapidated warehouse.  A shoeshine boy flicks open his newspaper, passing time until a customer arrives. None ever will, because shoeshine boys only exist in the movies.  Perched on an upturned milk crate is a tall and slender young man. Let's call him Lil Buck, because that is his name. Bored, he puts in his earphones and fires up a song.  Suddenly, the music brings him to life. He springs off the crate and contorts his body to an irresistible beat, defying gravity as he dances on walls and shop-fronts.  That's how Apple chose to promote their new wireless headphones earlier this year - and the song selected for the soundtrack was Marian Hill's Down.  Image copyright Apple Image caption The \"Stroll\" commercial has been watched more than 12m times  A sparsely atmospheric track, it pits Samantha Gongol's husky voice against a simple piano figure before crashing into a staccato beat in the chorus.  Apple's advertising agency, Media Arts Lab, stressed the importance of finding \"an unknown band\" for their commercial.  \"People get excited when they discover a new band,\" music supervisor Peymon Maskan told Music Week earlier this year.  \"They pull out their phone to Shazam the track and they tell their friends. That's a music fan's experience when discovering an ad like this.\"  Within days of the advert airing, the song had racked up 12 million views on YouTube and Down became the most searched-for song in America - ahead of Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars.  Nielsen Soundscan, which compiles the charts, said sales of the song jumped from \"negligible\" (not worth reporting) to 101,000 in the space of a week. In the UK, it was streamed more than 3 million times.  \"That commercial was the catalyst for a lot of things,\" says keyboardist and producer Jeremy Lloyd.  \"It put us in so many people's living rooms - and to have them instantly love the song felt so validating for all the work we had done.\"  As they take a break from making their second album, the duo tell the BBC how they got together and found their sound.  **How did the band get together?**  _Samantha_: Jeremy and I have been friends since we were about 12 or 13. We got the name Marian Hill from a production of The Music Man that we were in together in eighth grade. He played Harold Hill, I played Marian Paroo and we combined our character names.  We stayed friends throughout high school and college, until Jeremy showed me a beat and asked if I wanted to write with him. That song was called Whisky, and the rest is history.  **Right out of the gate you had a unique, minimalistic sound. How did it come about?**  _Jeremy_: We really stumbled into it. At the time we'd written a couple of other things together that were all over the map musically. Then I was playing Sam a couple of different beats and I had one that had this hip-hop feel to it - and that was the Whisky beat. Neither of us had ever made anything like it before.  I was able to recognise how much better it was - and so, for me, the goal became, how do you carry this forward?  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption \"Jeremy and I can be honest without hurting each other's feelings,\" says Samantha  **And what was the answer?**  _Jeremy_: At that point, it still wasn't that serious, necessarily. It was just a thing we'd made. And when I was about to graduate college, I decided I wanted to give it a real try, so I emailed, like, 50 blogs and thankfully people picked up on the song and liked it. From then on it's been this slow, steady stream of people wanting to hear more.  **Samantha, your vocals are very jazzy. Who were your influences?**  _Samantha_: I grew up loving the diva vocalists - Whitney Houston, Lauryn Hill, Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James. I was a huge Norah Jones fan too. That was a huge watershed moment for me, in terms of discovering a contemporary vocalist that I connected with.  _Jeremy_: So often in songs, there's no room for the vocal to sit - the voice is just pasted on top, so the whole mix is throbbing at the seams. With our stuff I try to make sure the vocal has space, and you can hear all the textures and nuances that would otherwise get lost.  **Before Marian Hill, Samantha did some work as a \"top liner\", writing melodies for big pop singers. What was that like?**  _Samantha_: Writing sessions are kind of like blind dating: You're just thrown into a room together and you hope you get along and make something incredible.  **How did you go about writing Down?**  _Samantha_: We were just messing around in the studio and I think the piano line came first, Jeremy?  _Jeremy_: Yeah, it was the first thing we'd written on a piano. I was goofing around and I stumbled on that piano line. It wasn't like, \"OK, we're writing a song now.\" I wasn't quite sure about it. But I asked Sam, \"Do you think we could do something with this?\" and she figured out a melody.  Looking back on it, it was such a simple process. I'm pretty sure it was all one night.  Image copyright Republic Records Image caption The duo released their debut EP in 2013  **The song's about going to a party against your better judgment, is that right?**  _Samantha_: We just wanted to have fun with it. There are so many party songs about getting on the dancefloor and throwing your hands in the air (like you just don't care).  We thought it could be cool to write it from the perspective of Marian Hill, and what it would sound like if we did a song like that. \"I'm not sure I want to go, but do you?\" And then the crash of the chorus was the party itself.  **The Apple commercial really fitted the song. How much input did you have? **  _Jeremy_: We probably would have had a veto if we'd hated it, but it very much was on them. They put it together and we were just like, \"Wow, this is perfect.\"  **What effect did it have?**  _Jeremy_: It was amazing because our album [Act One] had been out for a minute and our fans were loving it, but it hadn't really broken out to a larger audience. Having this spotlight, it put us in so many people's living rooms, and to have them instantly love the song felt so validating for all the work we had done. It was a great way to finish off the album campaign.  Image copyright Republic Records Image caption The band will be playing in the UK later this year  **So what comes next? **  _Jeremy_: We've been writing a lot over the last two months, together in New York and at home in Philadelphia. It's an exciting point to be at, coming off the success of Down, so we're really excited to get these songs out to our new fans.  **What changes are you making compared to the first album?**  _Jeremy_: It's the same aesthetic, only it's a little more brash. But we're right in the middle of it and that direction could change.  **And when do we get so hear it?**  _Jeremy_: It will be within a six-month window. We have a deadline in mind.  _Samantha_: Probably in the fall.  _Marian Hill's Act One (The Complete Collection) is out now.

The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines used.  The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes.  Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones.  It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the West coast of the US, where waters are deep.  \"This is a tech development project to ensure it's working in open sea conditions. It's a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,\" said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind.  Image caption The huge turbines are currently being moved into place  So far, one giant turbine has already been moved into place, while four more wait in readiness in a Norwegian fjord.  By the end of the month they'll all have been towed to 15 miles off Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, where they'll float upright like giant fishing floats.  While the turbines are currently very expensive to make, Statoil believes that in the future it will be able to dramatically reduce costs in the same way that manufacturers already have for conventional offshore turbines.  \"I think eventually we will see floating wind farms compete without subsidy - but to do that we need to get building at scale,\" said Mr Delp.  * * *  ## How big? The jaw-dropping dimensions of the technology used:  Image caption The turbines can operate in water up to a kilometre deep    * The tower, including the blades, stretches to 175 metres, dwarfing Big Ben   * Each tower weighs 11,500 tonnes   * The box behind the blades - the nacelle - could hold two double-decker buses   * Each blade is 75 metres - almost the wing span of an Airbus   * The turbines can operate in water up to a kilometre deep   * The blades on the towers have been a particular focus for innovation.    * Statoil says the blades harness breakthrough software - which holds the tower upright by twisting the blades to dampen motions from wind, waves and currents.   * * *  The operation to begin shifting the first of the 11,500 tonne giants happened dramatically in the half-light of a Norwegian summer night.  Crews secured thick cables to tug boats and used remote-controlled submarines to check for obstacles.  Finally the giant was on the move, floating on a sealed vase-like tube 78 metres deep, its bottom filled with iron ore to weight the base and keep it upright in the water.  ## Price drop  The price of energy from bottom-standing offshore wind farms has plummeted 32% since 2012 - far faster that anyone predicted.  The price is now four years ahead of the government's expected target, and another big price drop is expected, taking offshore wind to a much lower price than new nuclear power.  The Hywind project is being run in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi firm Masdar. The \u00a3190m cost was subsidised by bill-payers under the UK government's Renewable Obligation Certificates.  The bird charity RSPB Scotland opposed the project - not because it dislikes the technology but because it believes too many offshore turbines in the area have already been approved.  Image caption Thick mooring lines will tether the towers to the sea base  It fears thousands of sea birds may be killed by the offshore wind farms, although it admits that estimates are hugely uncertain because it is impossible to count bird corpses at sea.  The RSPB's Aidan Smith told BBC News: \"Generally we are very enthusiastic about floating wind technology because it allows turbines to be placed far offshore - away from seabird nesting sites, and it helps us tackle climate change.  \"We oppose the Hywind project because it adds to a situation we already believe is a problem.\"  Floating turbines may create a new frontier for energy - but scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warn far more investment in additional new technologies is urgently needed for governments to keep promises on reducing emissions.  _Follow Roger on twitter @rharrabin_", "newsHeadline": "World's first floating wind farm emerges off coast of Scotland - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-40699979", "countriesMentioned": ["Japan", "Canada", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Map of Jordan](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/54767000/gif/_54767919_jordan_map.gif)  The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a small country with few natural resources, but it has played a pivotal role in the struggle for power in the Middle East.  Jordan's significance results partly from its strategic location at the crossroads of what Christians, Jews and Muslims call the Holy Land. It is a key ally of the US and, together with Egypt, one of only two Arab nations to have made peace with Israel.  The desert kingdom emerged out of the post-World War I division of the Middle East by Britain and France.  The population at that time was largely made up of tribes which had taken part in the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire.

The death in February 1999 of King Hussein, who ruled for 46 years, left Jordan still struggling for economic and social survival, as well as regional peace.  ## Calls for reform  His son, Abdullah II faces the task of maintaining stability while accommodating calls for reform. A blueprint for long-term political, economic and social change - known as the National Agenda - has yet to be implemented, and the Arab Spring popular revolts across the region found some resonance in street protests.  Jordan's reputation as one of the region's safest countries was dealt a blow in late 2005 when dozens of people were killed in suicide bomb attacks on hotels in the capital. Iraq-based Islamic militants claimed responsibility. The king said Jordan had been targeted because of its location and its stances.  The civil war in neighbouring Syria has seen Jordan play host to some 600,000 Syrian refugees, while the resurgence of Islamic militancy in Iraq also presents security challenges for Amman.  Unlike Arab states to the south and east, Jordan has no oil of its own. Its resources are limited to phosphates and agricultural produce. The economy depends largely on services, tourism and foreign aid, of which the US is the main provider. Jordan prides itself on its health service, one of the best in the region.  Jordan engaged in two conflicts abroad in 2014 and 2015, taking part in air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Police officers, in rows three deep, blocked the gates to the Wat Dhammakaya temple compound. Around the back, helmeted soldiers guarded alleyways, with some crawling through surrounding rice-fields. It was, they explained, a restricted military zone. Nobody was allowed inside.  The official reason for this siege was that the elderly abbot, Phra Dhammachayo, was wanted on multiple criminal charges related to a collapsed credit union and police believed he was being hidden inside the temple.  It was the largest security operation since the 2014 coup, involving thousands of troops and police officers, trying to flush him out. At one point it seemed certain they would storm the temple. Conservative supporters of the government made no secret of their wish to see what they view as a dangerously deviant Buddhist sect shut down.  But then, after three weeks, the operation was suddenly called off.  The police, after their third search through the sprawling complex, appeared to have been convinced that the abbot was no longer there. So the temple's passionate followers, who had been confined by the police in a nearby marketplace, were finally allowed to enter. Even now it remains unclear what exactly the police wanted to achieve.  ## Security threat?  As so often in Thailand, the official explanation is misleading. Allegations of financial malpractice have hung over the temple and its charismatic abbot for decades. They also hang over many other institutions and individuals in Thailand, many of whom are neither investigated nor prosecuted. To be pursued by the state with this much commitment suggests that much larger issues are at stake.  Image caption The temple is famous for its futuristic golden dome  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It is renowned for holding visually spectacular mass events  Wat Dhammakaya is controversial. The temple compound has been constructed on a vast scale, with a huge, open-air auditorium, centred on a gold, flying- saucer-shaped chedi (stupa). Other futuristic buildings are dotted around the site - it is quite unlike any other Buddhist temple. It does not hide the fact that it is perhaps the wealthiest religious sect in Thailand.  The auditorium can, we were told, accommodate up to one million people, and Dhammakaya is famous for its impressively choreographed mass-meditations, sometimes by candlelight.  The movement is big on discipline. Its stripped-down interpretation of traditional Buddhist thinking and practices, and the intense, shared experience of meditation, has proven very appealing to its urban, middle-class followers, whose intense devotion to Phra Dhammachayo has been likened by some to a form of cult worship. The emphasis on donations has prompted accusations that it has commercialised Buddhism.  So it should come as no surprise that a military government bent on restoring traditional values, and backed by ultra-conservatives who want to see the Buddhist clergy cleansed of corrupting, modern influences, dislikes Wat Dhammakaya. A former senator, Paiboon Nititawan, who has led the calls for the temple to be taken over, goes further and argues that it is a threat to national security.  \"Phra Dhammachayo is ready to ask his followers to protect him, and those tens of thousands of people could easily turn into a mob. The abbot's followers insisted the police needed their permission to enter, and that they would only comply with their orders when Thailand is democratic again. This is like declaring autonomy, and denying the sovereignty of the state.\"  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police blocked access to the temple as they searched for the missing abbot  Image caption Phra Pasura Dantamano rejects suggestions that the temple and its supporters pose any kind of threat  Temple followers laugh off these accusations as absurd. Spokeperson Phra Pasura Dantamano, a former Thai Airways flight attendant who became a monk at Dhammakaya 11 years ago, said that even if the security forces stormed the temple, they would face only peaceful resistance.  \"We are just a temple, we are not a threat to national security. As you can see, we are women and old people, chanting and meditating. We are not dangerous.\"  ## 'Outside politics'  But the government continues to push its argument that there is something sinister about Wat Dhammakaya.  Last weekend the police showed off a large cache of weapons seized, they said, from the home of a now-exiled dissident. Although many of the weapons were ancient, the police argued that there was a plan to arm the temple's supporters and even to assassinate top government officials.  The attempt to link the temple with this dissident is telling. His name is Wuthipong \"Kotee\" Kochathamakun, one of the most outspoken members of the \"red-shirt\" movement, which backed the government unseated by the coup. He left Thailand even before the coup and has been charged in absentia with lese majeste, insulting the monarchy. He was singled out by the military in 2014 as a dangerous radical, although other red-shirt activists say his tough talk was largely posturing.  But the police statements help reinforce the government's view that Wat Dhammakaya is allied to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose parties won every election held over the past 20 years and whose destruction as a political force is still thought to be the primary, though unstated, aim of the 2014 coup leaders.  Again the temple denies this charge, insisting it is above politics and pointing out that its followers come from all political factions.  More do appear to come from the red-shirt side; a number of prominent red politicians attend the meditation sessions. But academic James Taylor from Adelaide University, who has studied Wat Dhammakaya for years, believes the notion of a political alliance is now outdated.  \"The movement was clearly ambitious during its early decades, contesting religious convention by attempting to reframe the religious system from within, recruiting economically and politically influential individuals... But in the past decade it has remained outside of politics in an effort to disassociate itself from any political alliances.\"  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thai authorities fear supporters of the temple could evolve into a powerful force like the red-shirt movement  There are striking parallels between the methods used by Wat Dhammakaya and Mr Thaksin's political movement to build a mass support base. Both offered a powerful sense of belonging to people feeling rootless in Thailand's increasingly urban and material society. Both were skilled at using modern media to project a simple, appealing philosophy and skilled at raising large amounts of money, an essential ingredient for any successful movement in Thailand.  Indeed the temple is the largest institution in the country not under the military's control, and its refusal to hand over its abbot is the most sustained defiance of military rule since the coup.  ## Triple transition  But there is another equally important factor which may have driven the government to act. Buddhism itself has been in crisis in Thailand for many years, as the modern, material world has either corrupted parts of the monkhood, or made its role seem less relevant, much as the church has lost its influence in Western societies. The popularity of Wat Dhammakaya is a symptom of that lost faith in traditional religion.  And this matters in a country lacking the reinforcing narrative of an anti- colonial struggle that has defined the identity of so many other countries in this region. Thailand's official national slogan has long been \"Nation, Religion, King\", although the military government has now added \"People\" to the slogan, and an \"s\" to \"Religion\" to acknowledge that not every Thai is Buddhist.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Thai monarchy and Buddhism are seem as symbiotically linked  Image copyright AFP Image caption Thailand's widely-revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on 13 October 2016, triggering national mourning  Just as the monarchy is seen by Thailand's rulers as the essential institution holding the country together and legitimising governments, so the monarch's official role as protector of Buddhism gives each occupant of the throne a unique, sacred stature. Kings preside over the most important Buddhist rituals at the most prestigious temples. The two institutions reinforce each other.  And that symbiotic relationship is never more important than in a time of transition, as now, after the defining, 70 year-long reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and while his untested son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, is shaping his own, very different reign, one which the harsh penalties of the lese majeste law prevent any Thailand-based journalist from writing about it freely.  Presiding over his father's elaborate cremation later this year will be an important source of legitimacy for the new king. But his relationship with the Buddhist hierarchy also matters. Already he has made his mark, restoring the monarch's right to name the Supreme Patriarch, the head of the Sangha, the body that regulates the faith, but which has lain moribund for some years.  King Vajirakongkorn's command to strip the royal monastic titles from Phra Dhammachayo and his de facto replacement as abbot also signals royal support for the government's move against the temple.  Thailand is in the midst of a complex and potentially dangerous, triple transition; a delicate royal succession, a battle over the future of Buddhism and a still uncertain political transition to a military-guided democracy.  Given that, a sect as controversial as Wat Dhammakaya was perhaps bound to be caught up in the turbulence.", "newsHeadline": "The curious case of a hidden abbot and a besieged temple - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39263793", "countriesMentioned": ["Thailand"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05972cj.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionSessions said he loved the job and the department  US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he will continue to serve Donald Trump despite sharp criticism from the president.  Mr Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday he would never have appointed Mr Sessions if he had known he was going to recuse himself from leading a Russia investigation.  He also said Mr Sessions had given \"bad answers\" at his confirmation hearing.  Mr Sessions recused himself after admitting meeting Russia's ambassador.  Associated Press news agency quoted a Trump adviser as saying the president's comments did not mean he was going to sack the attorney general but the adviser questioned whether such a public dressing-down might prompt him to quit.  However, Mr Sessions said on Thursday he would not resign but would continue running the justice department effectively.  \"I have the honour of serving as attorney general,\" he said.  \"It is something that goes beyond any thought I would have ever had for myself.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Sessions was one of Donald Trump's earliest supporters for the presidency  \"We love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\"  Mr Sessions would have headed the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election. Congress is also conducting inquiries.  His recusal ultimately led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to lead the investigation.  The Times interview reflects the anger the president feels at this development.  He said: \"A special counsel should never have been appointed in this case... Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.\"  Mr Trump said Mr Sessions had given him \"zero\" notice of the recusal.  He then reflected on the \"bad answers\" Mr Sessions gave at his Senate confirmation hearing in January at which he denied meeting any Russians. He later revealed he had met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.  * * *  ## Analysis: The price of loyalty  **Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter **  With Donald Trump, loyalty will only get you so far.  Mr Sessions was the earliest and most enthusiastic of Mr Trump's top-tier political supporters, and he was rewarded with a plum Cabinet appointment. Now, however, that position of power appears not quite as golden a prize.  While the former Alabama senator has toiled to implement the president's agenda as attorney general, Mr Trump personally blames him for the ongoing independent counsel investigation that has bedevilled his presidency.  The irony is that while Mr Trump views Mr Sessions's recusal from the Russia probe as a betrayal, the attorney general made clear during his confirmation hearings that he would likely do just that if he were implicated in an investigation that had not yet begun in earnest.  It was only later that then-FBI Director James Comey - himself a target of the president's scorn - revealed the Trump campaign itself was under the microscope.  Now the president has made clear that Mr Sessions lacks his full confidence. While the attorney general says he loves his job and plans to keep it, how secure can his position be when his boss lobs bomb after bomb his way from the White House?  * * *  ## Six months of Trump  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p0591sl8.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionCommander in tweets: What we can learn from Trump's Twitter", "newsHeadline": "Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions 'to stay in job' - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40674718", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Apple iphone](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/170E4/production/_90963449_iphone.silhoutte.g.jpg) Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Same same - but different?  Wednesday is a big day in the tech world. Apple is holding its annual launch event where the new iPhone 7 is expected to be revealed.  The much-heralded device comes just as rival Samsung has recalled its flagship Note 7 over battery issues.  Many commentators expect Apple to have ditched the headphone jack, leaving only one port.  The previous model - the iPhone 6S - was the world's bestselling handset, according to new research.  The study, by Strategy Analytics, said 14.2 million copies of the phone shipped between April to June, accounting for 4% of the market. By contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge shipped 8.3 million units over the same period.  However, both fell short of the earlier iPhone 6, which shipped 26.3 million units over the same months in 2015.  \"Smartphone growth is sluggish at the moment due to ongoing economic volatility worldwide, high ownership penetration in most major countries, and a lack of new innovation from device manufacturers,\" commented the market research firm's director Linda Sui.  ## Two lenses  Dropping the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 would encourage consumers to use Bluetooth headphones or buy those compatible with Apple's Lightning port, which is also used for charging.  However, old gear would not be completely obsolete, as Apple is expected to include an adapter jack.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The new phone is likely to stick with two sizes of the iPhone 6  Camera quality is expected to be improved and this time round the upgrade might mean a two-lens clicker for some of the bigger models.  Other handsets' dual-lens camera can take pictures with two different exposures, then combine the two images for improved picture quality - but it is unknown how Apple would implement the feature.  * * *  ## Analysis: Dave Lee, North America Technology correspondent  Another year, another iPhone. But then, it's hardly just been \"another year\" for Apple, has it?  Since last September, when we saw the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the tech giant's world has been turned upside down. A war over encryption, a declining iPhone, a continuing struggle in China and, most recently, the tax bill to end all tax bills.  Distractions, lots of them. And it doesn't look like the new iPhone is going to deflect much of that attention away.  While we're used to saying \"evolution, not revolution\" in the smartphone market, this upgrade is not expected to turn many heads nor send customers running to the phone shop to upgrade.  If, as we expect, the headphone jack is removed from the device, expect a lot of anger from those who don't want to be ushered into buying wireless headphones.  Then again, Apple faced the same kind of anger when it rolled out the smaller \"lightning\" charging port, but everyone's just about got over that. Take a look at the \"old\" Apple charger and tell me it doesn't look almost comically massive. In hindsight, the right call.  A better camera would go down extremely well - more photographs are taken with iPhones than any other device. But some reported leaks suggest only the larger, less popular iPhone size will get the new camera technology.  Looking a bit further ahead, some are speculating that Apple is holding back this time around, instead saving new features for 2017 and what will be the iPhone's 10th anniversary.  * * *  Other expected change include increased storage and better speakers.  The new phone is also said to be water resistant, handling submersion for up to 30 minutes - a feature already offered by several of Apple's Android competitors from the likes of Samsung or Sony.  Apple is thought to be sticking with its two sizes, meaning there would be an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus.  Neither is the design thought to be changing much, giving it the same overall look as the current models.  Rumour has it there will be more colours available, for instance reintroducing black as an option.  While the new models will be revealed to the world at the launch, consumers will have to wait a few weeks before they are shipped. Pre-orders are expected to open on Friday.  The timing still is crucial. Samsung beat Apple by releasing its Galaxy Note 7 last month. The device was well received by users and critics alike and started selling well.  Image copyright Ariel Gonzalez Image caption A Galaxy Note 7 reportedly caught fire shortly after its charger was unplugged  But then reports about batteries heating up and sparking some fires prompted Samsung to launch an embarrassing recall last week - just days before the new iPhone makes its debut.  While Samsung's battery problems might tilt some prospective buyers toward the iPhone 7, Apple depends on the ongoing success of its smartphones as they have become its biggest source of revenue.  And after recent bad publicity ranging from issues around security flaws to tax problems, the world's most valuable listed company hopes the iPhone will be a hit.", "newsHeadline": "Apple expected to unveil new iPhone 7 - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37293474", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "At your next meeting, wait for a pause in conversation and try to measure how long it lasts.

Anglophones tend to be most uncomfortable with long gaps in a discussion. And yet, knowing when to be tight-lipped can give you the upper hand in everything from sales deals and pay negotiations to presentations and staff development. Silence really is golden.  **Cultural norms **  What one culture considers a perplexing or awkward pause, others see as a valuable moment of reflection and a sign of respect for what the last speaker has said. Research conducted at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands in Dutch and also in English found that when a silence in conversation stretched to four seconds, people started to feel unsettled.  In contrast, a separate study of business meetings found that Japanese people were happy with silences of 8.2 seconds \u2013 nearly twice as long as in Americans\u2019 meetings.  _You might also like:_  These cultural differences are reflected in the saying in the US that \u2018the squeaky wheel gets the grease\u2019 while in Japan it\u2019s reckoned that \u2018a silent man is the best one to listen to\u2019.  In Japan, the power of silence is recognised in the concept of _harage_i (belly talk), which suggests that the best communication is when you don\u2019t speak at all. \u201cAs soon as you need words there\u2019s already a failure to understand each other so you\u2019re repairing that failure by using words,\u201d says Dr Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University in the US.  > No-one is saying anything but everybody\u2019s thinking.

They are engaged. The frame around silence at that point can be very positive.\u201d  So why do mother-tongue English speakers find long pauses hard to handle?  In the US, it may stem from the history of colonial America as a crossroads of many different peoples, says Carbaugh. \u201cWhen you have a heterogeneous complex of difference, it\u2019s hard to establish common understanding unless you talk and there\u2019s understandably a kind of anxiety unless people are verbally engaged to establish a common life,\u201d he says. This applies also to some extent to London, he adds.  In contrast, he says, \u201cWhen there\u2019s more homogeneity perhaps it\u2019s easier for some kinds of silence to appear. For example, among your closest friends and family it\u2019s easier to sit in silence than with people you\u2019re less well acquainted with.\u201d  **Tactics **  The fact that English speakers are generally so awkward around silence is partly why it can be such a powerful tool.  Sales expert Gavin Presman consistently pauses after making a pitch \u2013 after reading that counsellors should wait five seconds after a patient finishes speaking. \u201cIn business, five seconds might be too long, so I leave three seconds and what happens is remarkable,\u201d says Presman, director of UK-based training and development provider Inspire.  Recently, a potential customer told him, \u201cYou\u2019re very expensive and I\u2019m not sure if we can afford that.\u201d Presman said he understood, and then waited. Ten seconds later the other party said he saw the value of the training and wanted to go ahead.\u00a0 \u201cWe often think that silence is people simply not speaking,\u201d says Presman. \u201cBut it allows both people to settle down and reflect a bit deeper.\u201d  > Silence is the hardest technique to learn. It\u2019s against our instincts. We want to fill in the blanks \u2013 Katie Donovan  Katie Donovan adheres to the adage, \u2018He who speaks first, loses.\u2019\u00a0 Early in her career, the founder of US-based consultancy Equal Pay Negotiations interviewed for a job in sales and was offered it on the spot. When the interviewer named a salary, she said she\u2019d get back to him next week and then sat quietly. He raised the offer. She repeated her tactic. Finally, he made a third offer of 20% more than the first. She accepted.  \u201cMore than product knowledge or anything else, silence is the hardest technique to learn,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cIt\u2019s against our instincts. We want to fill in the blanks.\u201d  Rather than waiting until a tough negotiation, she recommends practising with friends and colleagues. \u201cAsk a simple question, like \u2018What did you do at the weekend?\u2019 And then shut up. Once you\u2019ve practised keeping quiet it\u2019s very useful throughout your whole life, from hanging out with friends to buying a house.\u201d  **When to speak up **  Of course, there are times when it\u2019s better to speak up. Silence can sometimes be misinterpreted, says Tannen. Researchers of courtroom interaction found lawyers advised clients giving testimony to think before answering and not jump in immediately. But juries often suspected that a silence before speaking meant the person was concocting a lie, she says. \u201cThe intention and the effect of silence are often different.\u201d  In the workplace that can mean a manager announcing a decision and assuming that if staff are unhappy they will speak up, she explains. The employees, however, may see no point in saying anything because the boss has made up their mind. \u201cThat\u2019s a very dangerous difference,\u201d she says.  Learning how to face silence is an important skill, says Matthew MacLachlan of UK-based Learnlight, a language and soft skills training provider \u2013 especially when working across cultures.  \u201cChinese negotiators are very, very aware that Americans like to fill silences and they are trained to stay silent and impassive because that will make the Americans uncomfortable and possibly make concessions without the Chinese having to do anything,\u201d he says.  So, what\u2019s the best response? \u201cGrit your teeth and wait it out. Don\u2019t offer a compromise or concession just because they are not speaking. If you have to say something, ask a direct question, such as \u2018What\u2019s your initial reaction to that offer?\u2019  \u201cOnce a silence is getting into 45 seconds you could say, \u2018Let\u2019s come back to that in a minute and proceed with the next part of our negotiation.\u2019\u201d  In presentations, silence can be far more effective than dramatic passion, he adds. \u201cBefore starting, look at the audience and be silent for a moment because that says, \u2018I\u2019m in control. I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m confident.\u2019\u201d  > Give people a moment of silence to get beyond the emotional response and to start thinking cognitively  A classic example was when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs launched the first iPhone, says MacLachlan. \u201cHe introduced pauses so that you didn\u2019t miss his key points. Because silence makes us nervous, our instinctive reaction is that we\u2019d better pay attention, there\u2019s something going on here.\u201d  Equally, when giving feedback to staff or trainees, pauses count \u2013 especially if there are negatives. \u201cIf you keep talking you\u2019re spoon feeding. Give people a moment of silence to get beyond the emotional response and to start thinking cognitively and processing,\u201d says MacLachlan.  Silence can be an inward-focused thoughtful activity or an outward stillness where you give yourself the time to watch and think and listen to the world around you, says Carbaugh. Having observed the use of silence in Finland and also among the Blackfeet Nation, a North American Indian tribe in northern Montana in the US, he says he sees benefits far beyond wheeling and dealing.  \u201cSilence can be a very powerful focal point for understanding ourselves, understanding others, for developing better mutual understanding and more productive outcomes and that applies to business, politics, education, law, medicine, every realm of human life.\u201d  _To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our_\u00a0Facebook_ page or message us on _Twitter.  _If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features **newsletter**\u00a0called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

They decided to go to snorkelling, taking turns to go in the sea while the other one looked after their stuff. Paul had a swim and then dozed on a beach mat on the pebbles for a while. When he woke up he had no idea where he was or how he got there.  Not surprisingly, Paul was very scared. His wife took him to sit in the shade, desperately trying to find a way to calm him down and to work out what was happening to him. She told me in Radio 4\u2019s All in the Mind that she soon worked out that he wasn\u2019t able to form any new memories because he kept asking the same questions: \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve got sunstroke? Do you think I fell asleep in the Sun?\u201d This happened more than 20 times.  > He couldn\u2019t remember any of the previous 10 days of their holiday  Kirsty wondered whether this be the start of dementia. Fearing she might have to spend the rest of life looking after him, she drove him back to the town where they were staying, hoping that more familiar surroundings might trigger his memory. She had to order lunch for him because he didn\u2019t know what to have. He couldn\u2019t remember any of the previous 10 days of their holiday, even though part of it had involved meeting some relatives for the very first time.  By late afternoon he began to feel better, suggesting going for the walk they had discussed the previous day, suggesting his memory was returning. Within an hour everything had gone back to normal \u2013 everything apart from his missing memory of those six hours, which, to this day, has never come back.  Back home in the UK he visited his doctor, who told him he\u2019d had an episode of transient global amnesia, a condition that\u2019s more common in people over the age of 50 (which Paul was). Accident and emergency units are accustomed to seeing two or three cases a month.  During an episode, people still know how to drive and how to talk, but in a typical case such as Paul\u2019s they can\u2019t remember what they\u2019ve been doing in the preceding days. Repeated questioning of others, just as Paul did on the beach, is a hallmark of this diagnosis.  > Accident and emergency units are accustomed to seeing two or three cases a month  The cause is still something of a mystery. Initially doctors thought these attacks might be a symptom of epilepsy or a migraine, or even a mini-stroke. But now they are considered to be unrelated to other health issues. The seahorse-shaped hippocampus, which processes our autobiographical memories, allowing us to store them long-term, is thought to hold the key.  Adam Zeman, professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology at University of Exeter Medical School explains how it works: \u201cWhat we think happens is that the hippocampi get switched off temporarily. Paul\u2019s case is classic. You lose memory of the past couple of weeks and can\u2019t make new memories while the episode goes on.\u201d  Brain imaging studies support this theory, revealing temporary abnormalities in the hippocampus during an episode.  > People with a history of headaches were more likely to experience them  Reviewing 142 individual women with transient global amnesia, doctors in France found that these cases were precipitated by stressful emotional events such as an argument, while in men they happened more frequently after physical exertion or immersion in cold water. People with a history of headaches were more likely to experience them.  Occasionally, people with a different condition called transient epileptic amnesia can be misdiagnosed with transient global amnesia, but with this form of epilepsy, episodes are briefer and more frequent, often happening when someone has first woken up. Zeman says that most of the time diagnosis is easy: \u201cIf you see someone after an episode and they give the kind of description Paul gave, there\u2019s very little doubt. If you see them in the midst of an episode, it\u2019s a little more difficult and you\u2019d have to consider other possibilities, such as a mini-stroke, epilepsy or psychogenic amnesia.\u201d The big difference with psychogenic amnesia is that patients don\u2019t remember who they are, but they can lay down new memories.  The good news about transient global amnesia is that usually, it\u2019s mysteriously a one-off that\u2019s not indicative of any other problems. Only a very small percentage of those who experience one episode will ever have another. But if it happens to you it can, of course, be very frightening.  Paul hopes it won\u2019t ever happen again. But if it does, at least Kirsty will know what it is.  \\--  _Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter._  _If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Then, a family tragedy triggered a cataclysmic psychological change. Suddenly she was aware of other identities inside her, and the barriers between them were crumbling. The different identities belonged to her, Melanie felt, but \u2018her\u2019 at different ages, from three years\u2019 old to 16 and on into adulthood.  These ages were not random. Amid the confusing, terrifying mingling of different voices in one consciousness came memories of child abuse, the first episode occurring when she was three, the last when she was 16. \u201cI have no proof,\u201d she notes. \u201cI have to go with what I believe happened, and my reality.\u201d  Melanie has what used to be called multiple personality disorder, which is now more commonly referred to as dissociative identity disorder (DID). The change in name reflects an understanding that it\u2019s more than just changes in personality that are involved. Memories, behaviours, attitudes, perceived age \u2013 all can switch together.  \u201cWe\u201d \u2013 she generally refers to herself as \u2018we\u2019 \u2013 \u201chad lots of adult parts. Development should be seamless\u2026 But because we didn\u2019t grow up naturally, we would update ourselves\u2026 Finally, there were nine different adult parts, each managing a stage of our abuse-free adult life.\u201d  Living with DID can be \u201chell\u201d, she says. It is a breakdown of an aspect of everyday existence that the rest of us take for granted \u2013 our sense that we are one individual self. For Melanie, the abrupt awareness of her many different identities warring inside her was overwhelming. How could she possibly find a way to accommodate them all?  **Split into parts**  Melanie is talking from a sofa in a quiet consulting room at the Pottergate Centre for Dissociation and Trauma in Norwich, UK. The centre is run by Remy Aquarone, an analytical psychotherapist and a former director of the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation.  Over a 30-year career, Aquarone has worked with hundreds of people with a dissociative disorder. In most cases, he says, they have a history of childhood abuse, generally starting before the age of five.  In an attempt to cope with the traumatic experiences, the theory goes, the child \u2018dissociates\u2019 \u2013 it splits itself into parts. One part endures the abuse and contains the horrific emotional and physical impacts; another part exists afterwards. Or, there might be one part that endures the abuse, another that gets the body back to its bedroom, and another that goes down to breakfast in the morning. If the abuse goes on over years, and also if different scenarios and perpetrators are involved, many different parts may splinter off.  It\u2019s the dissociation that allows the child to keep going. In fact, \u201cit\u2019s the ultimate adaption system. It\u2019s using your unconscious cognition to adapt your way of thinking and behaviour in order to be more safe,\u201d Aquarone says.  Melanie describes it this way: \u201cIf you\u2019re in a totally impossible situation, you dissociate to stay alive. Trauma can freeze you in time. And because the trauma is ongoing over years, there are lots of little freezings happening all over the place.\u201d  Not everyone who endures childhood abuse \u2013 or any other form of ongoing major trauma \u2013 develops a dissociative disorder. Based on his work, Aquarone says there\u2019s another critical factor involved: the absence of a normal, healthy attachment to an adult.  In the field of developmental psychology, \u2018attachment\u2019 has a specific meaning: it\u2019s a bond that forms between an infant and a care-giver who supports and looks after that child, emotionally and practically, while also helping that child to learn about and manage his or her responses. Without that bond \u2013 prevented by bereavement, neglect or abuse \u2013 a child undergoing a trauma is left to fend for itself.  > Infants who do develop secure attachment go on to cope better generally with life  Reflecting on people with DID as a group, Melanie says: \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t learn as small children is a parent metaphorically holding you and helping you learn how to manage yourself.\u201d  Infants who do develop secure attachment go on to cope better generally with life, says Wendy Johnson, a psychology professor at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cFirst of all, they\u2019re better at dealing with other people in a way that is successful. Their relationships tend to be smoother. They tend to earn more money, be better appreciated and recognised by others, and get into less fights. They also tend to experience life more smoothly, so it\u2019s more pleasant to them.\u201d    This is not to say that our personalities are set for life in those early years. A relatively stable environment, in terms of relationships and work, helps to maintain a relatively stable personality. \u201cI think the fact our environments tend to have a lot of stability to them contributes to the consistency that we tend to display,\u201d says Johnson. But if these external influences change, we can change too.  Parenting, losing a job \u2013 these kinds of major life changes can provoke behaviours that surprise us, as well as changes in traits such as conscientiousness and extroversion. It\u2019s no wonder that young adulthood frequently involves a major questioning of identity, adds Johnson, as this is so often a time when lots of things \u2013 home, surroundings, friends \u2013 are in flux.  Without the unified sense of self that attachment and stability brings, dissociated identities can make someone\u2019s personality appear to swing wildly. Melanie has an anorexic part, and a part that attempted suicide twice because the pain of the barriers coming down felt unbearable. Her three-year-old part is easily scared by things that remind her of past traumas \u2013 like a scent or a man\u2019s way of walking \u2013 and in these situations she will freeze or even hide. On the other hand, the 16-year-old can be flirty.  It makes sense that Melanie will behave differently depending on \u2018who\u2019 is to the fore in her mind. She is not acting like her three-year-old self, or even remembering what it was like to be three. She\u00a0_is_\u00a0that three-year-old \u2013 until another identity comes to the fore.  **Connecting to the past**  Because memories of time spent in one identity are not always accessible to others, some people with DID \u2018lose\u2019 chunks of time \u2013 they feel as though they\u2019re often jumping forward days or even weeks. \u201cSome people go off and have affairs. Well, they\u2019re not really affairs, because they have no memory that they\u2019re married,\u201d Melanie observes.  For her, the effect is that she has no sense of the order in which things have happened in her life: \u201cAs babies, you get born and you have a timeline that goes through your whole being. If you get fragmented, you don\u2019t get that timeline.\u201d  > Psychologists used to think that nostalgia \u2013 the use of memory to sentimentally hark back to good times in the past \u2013 was negative and harmful  Her memories are further blunted by the subduing of normal emotional reactions \u2013 which are essential, both she and Aquarone say, to helping a person cope with severe trauma. But this lack of emotion didn\u2019t end when the abuse stopped: it had become the way Melanie\u2019s brain worked. \u201cI know I got married,\u201d she says, for example. \u201cBut I watched and observed it, rather than being fully engaged.\u201d  People with a dissociative disorder often report feeling very superficial, says Aquarone. \u201cAnd in a way, they are, because the essence of who you are is held inside.\u201d For most of us, our memories, enhanced by the emotions we felt at the time, provide a personal chain that reaches all the way back into childhood, providing a sense of self-continuity. \u201cI can refer back to my behaviour as a teenager, for example,\u201d he says, \u201cand hold on to a bigger picture [of myself]\u2026 The price of [dissociation] working is that\u2026 there\u2019s no tracking back to see how things were.\u201d Being with people, whether family or old friends, with whom you have plenty of shared memories stretching right back, can enhance that sense of an ongoing self persisting through the years. But the problem with relying on connections with people from the past, of course, is that old friends can move away \u2013 and people can die.  One psychological benefit of religious belief may be that, in theory, a relationship with God, with all its associated memories, can extend from early childhood through to death, and no matter where you are on the planet, it is there. As Aquarone says, \u201cYou can\u2019t take it away \u2013 and it transcends where you are.\u201d  There are other ways to help connect your present \u2018self\u2019 with the past. Psychologists used to think that nostalgia \u2013 the use of memory to sentimentally hark back to good times in the past \u2013 was negative and harmful. But there is now work finding the opposite. In fact, nostalgia seems to foster a sense of the self-continuing, and enhances a sense of belonging in the world.  This sense of a single, consistent self through time helps people to navigate life, and the social world in particular. But if it can be strengthened \u2013 and weakened \u2013 by experience, or lost altogether in DID, does it reflect the real you?  **Inner conflict**  _\u201cConsider the musical \u2018Grease\u2019, where Sandy sheds her goody-goody persona to become a leather-clad, pelvis-thrusting bad girl. Surely all this smokiness and gyration is Sandy. But just as surely, this is a performance designed to gain the approval of her peers, not the \u2018real\u2019 Sandy.\u201d_  The case of Sandy is highlighted in a review paper by Nina Strohminger and colleagues at Yale University on the concept of the \u2018true self\u2019, not just in relation to people with DID but to anyone at all.  Or, suggests Strohminger, consider the case of a man who\u2019s very religious and has homosexual impulses. \u201cHis religion prohibits him from acting on [them]\u2026 so every day he\u2019s fighting them,\u201d she explains. \u201cWho is the real person? Is it the person who is resisting the homosexual impulses, or the person who has them?\u201d  The answer, she\u2019s found, is that it depends who you ask. \u201cWhen you ask liberals, they say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the person with homosexual impulses.\u2019 But ask conservative people and they say, \u2018It\u2019s the part of him that wants to resist these impulses.\u2019 It all boils down to what you value. If you think it\u2019s okay to be gay, you\u2019re not going to see anything wrong with those deeper impulses.\u201d  Strohminger isn\u2019t aware of any work that has asked someone experiencing this kind of inner conflict what they actually think. \u201cBut from everything I\u2019ve observed in my studies, the prediction would be that\u2026 [whatever] you are projecting on to other people, the same standard would hold for you as well.  \u201cI\u2019m a psychologist, not a metaphysician,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut if you wanted to draw some metaphysical conclusions, you\u2019d have to understand that when normal, everyday people are thinking about their own identity and the identity of other people, this is informed by their own values and circumstances.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s all relative.  Strohminger has found that there is, however, one aspect of a person\u2019s typical pattern of behaviour that, consistently, is rated as being most fundamental to who someone is \u2013 even more so than their memories, or whether they\u2019re extravert or introvert, placid or easily driven to excitement or anger.  She started with thought experiments. In one, she asked volunteers to imagine other people changing in a variety of ways. And it was alterations to their moral traits \u2013 their relative honesty or dishonesty, loyalty or disloyalty, and so on \u2013 that the volunteers felt most changed them as people.  Next, Strohminger turned to families of people with dementia, which can involve not only memory loss but also changes in personality and moral sense (sometimes negative changes, such as a shift to pathological lying; sometimes positive ones, such as greater kindness). The relatives reported that it wasn\u2019t when their loved ones lost their memories that they became a \u2018different person\u2019, but rather when their moral sense altered.  > The solid, fixed sense of self most of us have is at least partly an illusion that allows us to avoid the mental distress  \u201cTraditionally, morality has not been given much attention in scholarly work about the nature of personal identity. Rather, it was thought that memory and distinctive characteristics, like your personality, is what made you,\u201d Strohminger says. \u201cOur results run counter to centuries of thought from philosophers and neuropsychologists.\u201d  Melanie says that some parts of her do seem to have a different moral sense. But she traces this back to varying life experiences for each part, and to the anchoring of some in past decades when different attitudes prevailed.  And people\u2019s moral sense\u00a0_can_\u00a0change over time, notes Wendy Johnson. \u201cI do think there are people who realise where they went wrong, and who decide they are going to be different, and they become different,\u201d she says.  Therefore, the fundamental heart of who we are \u2013 as far as other people are concerned, at least \u2013 can change. This suggests that the solid, fixed sense of self most of us have is at least partly an illusion that allows us to avoid the mental distress that comes with multiple identities. And as the experiences of Melanie and others with DID show, this illusion is a vital one.  **Breaking the barriers**  It was about four years after her parts started fully emerging that Melanie, who worked as a librarian, picked up a book called The Flock by Joan Frances Casey. She realised that, like Casey, she had DID.  She raised the idea with her husband of more than 20 years. \u201cHe said, \u2018You know what: that makes sense.\u2019 Because, he said, he\u2019d say to me one day, \u2018Do you want a coffee?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019d love a coffee.\u2019 Then, the next day, \u2018Do you want a coffee?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018You know I don\u2019t drink coffee, I\u2019m allergic to it!\u2019 The 16-year-old can\u2019t drink coffee and I love coffee. He used to say he never knew what he was coming home to. I never understood what he meant by that!\u201d  Is it surprising that she was married for so long to someone who didn\u2019t realise there were different parts inside her? \u201c[Now] he thinks it\u2019s mad he didn\u2019t pick up on this\u2026 But he loved me. And I was a good mum, in a practical sense\u2026 I was good at copying how other people behaved.\u201d Unlike some people with DID, Melanie does feel that she has a dominant, leading part, whose age matches that of her body. Is it possible, though, to say that the \u2018real\u2019 Melanie is not the three-year-old who\u2019s easily terrified,\u00a0_and_\u00a0the 16-year- old who flirts,\u00a0_and_\u00a0the 64-year-old who\u2019s sitting on the sofa in Remy Aquarone\u2019s consulting room, talking eloquently about a sense of being that she now realises is so different to most people\u2019s?  Good treatment has made a big difference. The first step was for the disorder to be correctly diagnosed, however, as DID can appear to be many other things. People who hear the voices of parts may be labelled schizophrenic; people who switch between depressed and excitable parts may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder; people who hide in a hospital because their identity is a terrified three-year-old may be thought to be having a psychotic episode; people whose emotional states seem to shift drastically might be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  And in the UK, at least, DID is a controversial diagnosis. It is listed in both of the main psychiatric manuals used around the world (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, produced by the American Psychiatric Association, and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, produced by the World Health Organization). But in practice, says Aquarone, there can still be reluctance among psychiatrists to accept it. DID is now thought to affect perhaps 1% of people (about the same rate as schizophrenia), yet there have been claims from sceptics that perhaps patients are simply acting out different identities, and that a proneness to fantasy explains the entire disorder.  Brain imaging work supports the idea that people with DID are not acting, and there is other research refuting such claims. In 2016, for example, a team at King\u2019s College London published a study of 65 women, including some diagnosed with DID. They concluded that the women with DID were no more fantasy-prone, suggestible or likely to generate false memories than those without a diagnosis. According to the authors, this result challenges the core hypothesis of the \u2018fantasy model\u2019.  Melanie is now a director of First Person Plural, a dissociative identity disorders association, and she frequently talks to psychologists, psychiatrists, GPs and care workers, spreading the word that DID is real. She and Aquarone recently helped to organise the first conference on services for people with trauma-related dissociation \u2013 it brought together clinicians from the NHS and the private and voluntary sectors. One of the big challenges, they note, is that it can take many months of therapy with a specialist in dissociative disorders to help a patient, but this is generally only available privately.  > When she felt able to start going away again for nights with her husband, the child identities inside her would help to gather what she needed  This was the kind of therapy that changed everything for Melanie, she says. When the barriers between the parts began to break down, she was overwhelmed. It took a strong bond with a therapist who could help the parts to talk to each other and respect each other for the \u201cwar\u201d inside her to begin to settle down.  For 10 years after her different identities began to break out, Melanie found it impossible to manage anything beyond the fundamentals of life. Then, as she learned to listen to the parts and the stories they had to tell, \u201cwe learnt to share the one life between us.\u201d  When she felt able to start going away again for nights with her husband, the child identities inside her would help to gather what she needed. \u201cEverybody would help pack. So we\u2019d have to take things for the three-year-old, like teddies and comforters, and I\u2019d end up packing three or four bags, because everybody had to bring their things.\u201d  But still, if they got to their destination and she found she didn\u2019t have the right clothes for that moment, she couldn\u2019t go out. At any given moment, it could have been an eight-year-old who was to the fore in her consciousness, or the 16-year-old, and they just wouldn\u2019t go out unless age-appropriately attired.  At one point, she used to allow the 16-year-old to \u201cdress the body\u201d, as she puts it, and get it to the library where she worked: \u201cWe\u2019d cycle, because of course the 16-year-old couldn\u2019t drive.\u201d This was on the understanding that the adult would have the day at work, then she\u2019d give the younger parts time in the evenings. \u201cThey\u2019d get to do the things they couldn\u2019t do in the day \u2013 from the little one having Smarties and watching Teletubbies, to making things, playing with teddies, doing a jigsaw.  \u201cOver time, we began to understand what was happening as a whole,\u201d she adds. In a threatening situation, perhaps someone walking into the library in a way that triggered awful memories, \u201cI could talk to the little ones and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to keep you safe\u2026 the library\u2019s a safe place. Just allow me to stay still and see if we really are in danger, and I promise you if we are, I\u2019ll handle it.\u2019\u201d  Now, the parts are all still there, but they coexist. \u201cWe are not one, but we all agree to live harmoniously together,\u201d says Melanie. \u201cWhich works well most of the time.\u201d  _This\u00a0__article__\u00a0was first published by Wellcome on\u00a0__Mosaic__\u00a0and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence._  _Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0_**_Facebook_**_, or follow us on _**_Twitter_**_._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0_**_sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter_**_, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

He\u2019s a stocky three-year-old, mostly slate grey, with a white stripe on his head and a pink splotch on his elongated, bull-terrier nose. So far, our only similarity is we\u2019re both waiting in a trailer that\u2019s serving as his examination room at Tufts University\u2019s veterinary school in North Grafton, Massachusetts.  Sputnik has canine compulsive disorder (CCD) and is at Tufts for a checkup with Nicholas Dodman, a veterinarian who has been studying CCD for over two decades. I\u2019m shadowing this visit to learn about Dodman\u2019s work and, selfishly, to learn something about myself; I was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) a few months ago.  When Dodman first started seeing these dogs, he realised he had been handed a potentially ideal animal model to study human OCD. But in 20 years of studying dogs, discovering genes that may be involved and new neural pathways, one problem has continually clouded his research: the debate over whether CCD can truly be compared to human OCD. \u201cWhen it comes to problems of the mind, people have a mental block,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mind is thought of as uniquely human.\u201d  Sputnik was a tail chaser, and would spin for hours on end. At the moment, he is completely still. Like me, it seems he keeps that kind of behaviour away from the public eye.  Two years ago, after rescuing Sputnik from a shelter, his owner Dan Schmuck went on a business trip. His mother called him to say that their new dog had started chasing his tail, and she couldn\u2019t get him to stop. At first, Schmuck and his wife thought it was funny. They took a video of their young puppy spinning, and you could hear them laughing in the background. But soon, the humour faded.  \u201cIt was as if I didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Schmuck explains. \u201cHis head will lurch all the way against his shoulder, and stare at his tail, as if his nemesis is staring right back at him. He will slowly start working up to chasing, and it will get faster and faster until his head is hitting whatever wall he bangs into. Even though he\u2019s getting hit so hard that you think he\u2019s getting a concussion, he will keep doing it until his teeth and his tail start hitting the wall and he\u2019s shooting blood all over the place.\u201d  Schmuck drove from his home in Baltimore to see Dodman in Massachusetts. Dodman had seen this kind of spinning many times before. Tail chasing is a common compulsive behaviour for dogs, and for bull terriers specifically. Particular breeds have particular behaviours they exhibit with CCD. Bull terriers spin, Dobermans lick their limbs and suck their flanks, Labradors hold objects or chew rocks, and King Charles spaniels snap at imaginary flies.  > Over the last two years, he has gone from being a dog that was going to have to be put down, to being a normal dog \u2013 Dan Schmuck  Like human OCD, which is commonly focused on washing, hoarding, counting or checking, canine compulsions fit into neat categories. And while these behaviours may sound trivial, they are performed to the extreme. They take over eating, sleeping and all basic functioning. In some cases, they can be fatal.  Sputnik steps out from the safety of Dodman\u2019s shadow, timidly eating treats. His tail hangs innocently between his legs, and I\u2019m having a hard time imagining him whirling, manic, out of control in a pool of his own blood. \u201cOver the last two years, he has gone from being a dog that was going to have to be put down, to being a normal dog,\u201d says Schmuck. \u201cHe maybe looks at his tail once a day. It\u2019s a miracle.\u201d  Sputnik is on Prozac now, along with a few other medications to temper his behaviour. Could Sputnik be like me, a person with OCD? Was he thinking about his tail right now, somewhere in the recesses of his doggy mind?  \u201cYou can\u2019t access an animal\u2019s thoughts, so the purists call it only canine compulsive disorder, not obsessive-compulsive disorder,\u201d Dodman says. \u201cBut it looks for all the world, when Dan is holding Sputnik back, that he\u2019s constantly thinking about it. That\u2019s an obsession.\u201d  **Steps into the spolight\u00a0**  In 1989, a popular science book called The Boy Who Couldn\u2019t Stop Washing was published. Its author, Judith Rapoport, then chief of the Child Psychiatry Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, had studied and treated all kinds of neuropsychiatric illness, but a fascination with OCD grabbed hold of her. People with OCD had to participate in detailed rituals and compulsions to assuage strange beliefs: that they had just killed someone, that everything was contaminated, that they had sinned in some way, that things had to be _just _right.  Before her book came out, OCD was thought to be rare. We now know it affects 1\u20133% of the population. Rapoport\u2019s book was one of OCD\u2019s first steps into the spotlight \u2013 she went on Oprah and Larry King Live. Millions of people began to understand something about their own odd behaviours, or those of their friends and family members. Soon, Rapoport started to get letters and phone calls \u2013 including some with questions she hadn\u2019t expected.  \u00a0\u201cA whole bunch of them talked about their dogs,\u201d she says.  People wrote that their dogs did these behaviours too, especially excessive washing. Did she think they had OCD? It was an interesting idea. \u201cIf people ask one weird question, you shrug it off,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if 20 of them ask it, you pay attention.\u201d  A dog owner herself, she went to her vet to ask about acral lick, a common CCD behaviour when a dog licks or sucks at its paw or leg until the fur and flesh are worn through, leading to infection, amputation and sometimes death. Her vet told her yes, acral lick was a huge problem with no good treatment options, and _his _dog suffered from it. She asked if he would be willing to try medication \u2013 the same medication given to people with OCD, which increases levels of the brain chemical serotonin.  \u201cWe put his dog on a dose that we guessed at, given the weight of dogs and the weight of people, and the dog had a remarkable response,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could say this all started when I cured my vet\u2019s dog.\u201d  Encouraged, Rapoport designed a double-blind controlled study. Dogs with acral lick received one of two drugs for OCD that targeted serotonin, or a placebo, or an antidepressant that worked for depression but not OCD and wouldn\u2019t alter serotonin levels. The results were \u201cdramatic\u201d: the only group that improved was the group that got the serotonin drugs.  Still, Rapoport took her findings with a grain of salt. As a psychiatrist, she says she usually needs to know what her patients think of their compulsions to give them a true OCD diagnosis: \u201cPatients with OCD have insight and they say, \u2018Look, this is very embarrassing, I think this is crazy what I\u2019m doing, but I can\u2019t stop,\u2019\u201d she explains. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t get that sort of information from animals, so animal models are often very limited for psychiatry.\u201d  **Family lines**  \u201cThe reason canine genetics are so cool is one word,\u201d Elaine Ostrander tells me. \u201cBreeds_.\u201d_  Ostrander is the chief of the Cancer Genetics and Comparative Genomics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute, and has been working in dog genetics for 25 years. Her lab develops dog genome databases to look for genes that could be important for animal health or translate to humans. She says they\u2019ve explored everything from infectious disease to cancer, including diabetes, kidney failure, retinitis pigmentosa and gout.  > The dogs\u2019 symptoms usually started around puberty, as is often the case in people  \u201cIf you want to understand the genetic underpinning of a complex disease, we know there\u2019s lots of genes involved,\u201d she says. \u201cIn human populations, there are dozens of genes that contribute. Every family is a little bit different. Some genes seem hereditary, some seem not to be, it\u2019s a very complex mosaic. In dogs, you simplify that mosaic.\u201d  Within breeds, dogs are genetically very similar. But also between breeds of related dogs, Ostrander can see commonalities. By looking for disease genes in sick dogs in closely related breeds, she can exclude false positives; if four similar breeds with a disease all carry the same gene, one that unaffected dogs don\u2019t have, she knows she\u2019s got a strong candidate.  In 1994, Dodman teamed up with Alice Moon-Fanelli, an animal-behaviour geneticist, to help him begin to explore the genetics of his dog patients. Ostrander had the genetic data and Moon-Fanelli started to gather phenotypes, the expression of those genes: including the details of each dog\u2019s behaviour, along with its breed, pedigree, age of onset, and anything else that might be useful.  Moon-Fanelli says when they started their project, the idea of CCD \u2013 not even as a model, just as a standalone disorder \u2013 wasn\u2019t widely accepted. Animal repetitive behaviours were considered \u201cstereotypies\u201d \u2013 mindless actions that were a result of poor environment or boredom, like tigers pacing in a cage at the zoo. \u201cI came into it asking, \u2018Why is this any different?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd looking at almost 400 bull terriers over the years, and all the Dobermans and cats, it became clear that it wasn\u2019t because of a suboptimal environment. These animals were pets, they had great lives in wonderful homes.\u201d  The dogs\u2019 symptoms usually started around puberty, as is often the case in people. Compulsive behaviours ran in family lines, just like people. And just as human psychology had to realise that human OCD wasn\u2019t a result of upbringing, animal medicine was doing the same.  \u201cOne living species to another, you know that they are obsessing and that they are possessed by demons that they cannot control,\u201d says Moon-Fanelli. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the same thing with people. It\u2019s just that people speak the same language so they can tell us what they\u2019re thinking. We have to develop our interpretation, and try to be objective, based on what we see in its behaviour.\u201d  Pamela Perry, a behaviourist at Cornell University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, isn\u2019t involved in Dodman\u2019s work. She treats animals that have a variety of behaviour problems, and says that while stereotypes and compulsions can often overlap, she does recognise a distinction. She agrees that we don\u2019t know _for sure_ if animals are obsessing. But she has seen dogs who don\u2019t just compulsively chase light and shadows: they even get up before dawn and wait for the sun to cast shadows that they can then chase. Another client had bought a new washing machine, and their dog would wait for it to turn on and spin along with the whole cycle. As soon as it stopped, he would stop.  \u201cIf they\u2019re waiting and anticipating, personally I think we can presume that they\u2019re obsessing to some degree,\u201d Perry says.  **Glutamate links**  We don\u2019t know exactly what goes wrong in the brain to cause OCD. We do know that a group of drugs known as SSRIs (like Prozac), which increase serotonin levels, seem to help \u2013 but only for some people. About half of people see a response to the SSRIs, and a \u201csuccessful\u201d response can mean as little as a 35% reduction of symptoms. As a recent review of OCD treatments said: \u201cThis means that even treatment-responsive patients may continue to have levels of symptoms in the mild-to-moderate range and spend hours daily preoccupied with their obsessions and compulsions.\u201d  Whether you believe in a dog model or not, one thing is becoming clearer in human OCD research: serotonin is not the complete story.  > The problem with the large number of behavioural disorders is that we don\u2019t really have a good clue as to what the underlying molecular change is  As Dodman had noticed, glutamate seems to be important. Recent neuroimaging of people with OCD has shown higher blood flow and activation in the cortico- striato-thalamocortical circuits, a network that loops from the deep centres of the brain to the prefrontal cortex_. _This area is dominated by glutamate pathways that are thought to generate controlled movement and thought, and to modulate behavioural routines. Some OCD researchers now hypothesise that SSRIs work not because of serotonin, but because they stop the release of glutamate. Further work, testing the cerebral spinal fluid levels of people with OCD, found that they had significantly higher levels of glutamate.  Still, knowing that glutamate plays a role, in dogs or in people, doesn\u2019t help discover the genes that cause this disorder in humans, which is where an accurate animal model could be extremely helpful.  \u201cThe problem with the large number of behavioural disorders is that we don\u2019t really have a good clue as to what the underlying molecular change is,\u201d says Ed Ginns, a neurologist and geneticist who works with Dodman. \u201cIf we can at least get that, we\u2019re confident that, with further molecular and clinical studies, pathways and even potential targets for treatment can be identified.\u201d  When he first met Dodman, Ginns had been studying diseases like bipolar disorder and depression in genetically closed populations like the Amish. For him, it was never an issue that Dodman\u2019s sample was built of Dobermans and terriers. He says it was compelling because, like the conditions of those Amish \u2013 and unlike other animal models \u2013 the dogs\u2019 disorder had arisen naturally.  \u201cThese are not artificial constructs,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are patients walking into his office with a real behavioural issue. It doesn\u2019t rely on us guessing what we think might be the gene or the change in a mouse that might model a disease.\u201d  Ginns and Dodman\u2019s first collaboration was a genome-wide analysis, comparing 92 flank- and blanket-sucking Doberman pinschers with 68 control Dobermans. They got one strong statistical hit in what Dodman calls a \u201cgenetic oasis\u201d \u2013 there was only one large gene there for them to look at, called neural cadherin or CDH2. In the brain, CDH2 is involved in the development of glutamate receptors.  \u201cIt was a great gene,\u201d Dodman says. \u201cEveryone basically took a big breath and stepped back. This was the first behavioural gene that had ever had anything to do with OCD, and one of the few behavioural genes that have been discovered.\u201d  > In brain imaging of his compulsive Dobermans, Dodman found that they had structural abnormalities associated with OCD in humans  The next step was to look for CDH2 in people. Dodman and Ginns took their research to the National Institutes of Health, and a group there analysed data they had from people with OCD. The results were inconclusive. They found a suggestion that some CDH2 variants might be associated with Tourette syndrome, but that picture was fuzzy as well.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t find something earth-shattering,\u201d says Jens Wendland, a physician and psychiatrist who co-authored the study. \u201cBut to be fair, we know now that the cohort would have needed to be much, much larger, at least an order of magnitude larger, to be properly powered to do that. And we tried the best we could with the means we had available at the time.\u201d  Wendland thinks that sequencing has advanced enough that it\u2019s more beneficial to study humans than to redo any dog studies. He is sceptical whether we can ever really be sure that a dog\u2019s symptoms can correspond to humans\u2019. \u201cWe will never really know that for sure, so you could argue why should we take this leap of faith in the first place?\u201d he says.  \u201cI would much rather start to work on the biology of genes identified from human studies, however challenging that may be. As opposed to starting with a gene mapped to a behaviour in nonhumans where I can never be certain that this is really affective of the condition that I want to treat.\u201d  **A guiding gene?**  In 2008, Dodman decided to take the initiative and move his theories to a clinical setting. For many years, he had been discussing his work with Michael Jenike, founder of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Institute at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. Jenike enjoyed his talks with Dodman but wasn\u2019t convinced. Like Judith Rapoport, he says that the trouble with dogs and birds and mice is that unless he can talk to them, he can\u2019t properly diagnose OCD. Still, he was willing to try giving some of his patients memantine, a glutamate-targeting drug normally used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s, which Dodman had started giving to dogs with severe CCD.  In a group of 44 patients, everyone got a drug to increase serotonin levels, but half were given memantine as well \u2013 and it worked. For those who also got the glutamate drug, symptoms reduced by 27% on average, compared to 16.5% for the others. It isn\u2019t perfect, but Jenike continues to use this combination of drugs with patients who aren\u2019t responding well to SSRIs. Dodman and Shuster had already patented the combination of drugs as a treatment for OCD, but their tech transfer office at Tufts couldn\u2019t get any pharmaceutical companies interested. However, subsequent research has supported the idea that both serotonin and glutamate pathways need to be addressed when treating OCD.  In brain imaging of his compulsive Dobermans, Dodman found that they had structural abnormalities associated with OCD in humans. In February 2016, a group led by Dan Stein, head of the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health at the University of Cape Town, published the results of a re-examination of the CDH2 gene in humans. Their sample was made of 234 people with OCD and 180 healthy controls, and their findings were more conclusive than the previous study: they found two differences in the CDH2 gene that seemed to be correlated with OCD, though Stein says more work is needed to fully understand the connection.  Dodman\u2019s latest work, published in 2016, compares dogs that have severe and mild cases of CCD. He found two areas of interest in the genome. The first has a human counterpart that is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia, and the other harbours serotonin receptor genes.  > As psychiatrists, we need to be field observers much more often than we are \u2013 Judith Rapoport  From these most recent findings and their connection with serotonin, Dodman has a new theory. He thinks that the CDH2 gene, which involves glutamate, is required for a dog to be genetically predisposed to CCD in the first place. A human might have a different predisposition gene, but Dodman guesses it involves glutamate too. Serotonin genes, he thinks, are modifiers that control to what degree a dog has CCD (or a person has OCD). He now hopes that someone will look for similar modifier genes in humans, or expand standard OCD treatment to include both serotonin and glutamate pathways.  Dodman still thinks that any hesitation to accept research based on a dog model of human OCD doesn\u2019t lie in specific doubts about the validity of the model, but in a greater philosophical problem: the difficulty in accepting that our minds might be closer than we want to believe to the minds of dogs.  \u201cIt really helps to be a veterinarian,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause one of the things people say when you\u2019re a vet is, they say: \u2018It must be so difficult because you have to learn all these differences between the various species.\u2019 The answer is, actually you don\u2019t. What you learn to do is appreciate the sameness.\u201d  **Understanding obsessions**  In her book, Rapoport wrote that she was amazed at the sameness of OCD behaviours. Though she remains unconvinced how much animal models will ultimately help, she did say that psychiatrists could learn from the work of ethologists, who study inborn behaviour patterns in animals. Rapoport\u2019s collie dog turned in circles \u2013 not compulsively, but before it lay down to sleep. In the dog\u2019s ancestors, that behaviour was conserved to trample down grass or ward off hiding snakes or insects. But in her suburban home, it remained.  \u201cThe highly selective nature of OCD behaviors is just as remarkable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWashing, grooming, hoarding \u2013 any theory of this disease must account for the incredible selectivity of these behaviours, which could be action patterns from an ethologist\u2019s field book. As psychiatrists, we need to be field observers much more often than we are.\u201d  The day after Sputnik, I meet Bella, another bull terrier who used to spin but after treatment has stopped almost completely. Bella\u2019s owner, Linda Rowe- Varone, has a similar tale to Sputnik\u2019s owners: one day her sweet puppy started to spin, and nothing she could do could stop her. Like Dan Schmuck, she tells me she almost reached breaking point.  \u201cThere was a time I really thought she was spinning so much that I could not keep her in my home anymore,\u201d she says with tears in her eyes. \u201cAnd Dr Dodman just kept telling me, \u2018Just wait it out, wait it out, you\u2019ve got to give her a little more time.\u2019 And I\u2019m really glad I did.\u201d  Bella is active, playing and running around the examination room. Rowe-Varone tells us that Bella is also obsessed with balls, and she has to limit what kinds of toys she is exposed to. I wonder where the vets draw the line? All dogs have a favourite toy, one they love to play with. When can they call it an obsession? (When did I go from being a person who liked to be clean, to becoming obsessed with cleanliness?) Rowe-Varone says that she has to keep balls hidden in the garage, and if Bella sees them, she will sit outside the garage door for hours.  The debate about whether dogs can truly obsess doesn\u2019t enter this room. The consensus here is that Bella knew her balls were in the garage and couldn\u2019t get them off her mind. I\u2019m struck by how accepting dogs as an animal model for human OCD required two shifts in thinking: not only did we have to become more animal, but we had to grant them a bit more humanity as well.  > Dodman remembers another odd eating ritual: a dog who would take individual pellets of food and place them in the button compressions in the couch cushion in the next room  Dodman remembers a dog that was obsessed with water. It lived mostly in New York City but when it went to the owner\u2019s Hamptons home it would jump into the pool and do laps for seven hours a day, whining in anxiety the whole time.  Stephanie Borns-Weil, who took over from Dodman as programme director at the Animal Behavior Clinic at Tufts last year, has seen a golden retriever obsessed with water too: it would get into the bathtub with the kids, or stand in puddles on its walks and refuse to move. Another dog she saw a few months ago would go into a lake by its house, take out five rocks and put them by a tree. If the owner removed them, it would return to the lake and get the rocks back.  One Doberman needed to cover her food before she ate. When her owner fed her, she put some paper towels next to her food. The dog would take a paper towel very delicately in her mouth, cover the food, and then uncover the food to eat it. If she couldn\u2019t perform this ritual she wouldn\u2019t eat. Dodman remembers another odd eating ritual: a dog who would take individual pellets of food and place them in the button compressions in the couch cushion in the next room. Only when he had put seven pellets into seven button holes could he eat the rest of the food out of his bowl.  I look back at Bella, who has bored of our chatting and is resting underneath a desk. The eating rituals that Dodman and Borns-Weil are describing are hitting a bit close to home, and maybe that\u2019s why, for the first time, I do recognise a bit of myself in Bella. There is a big container of balls above her head, which we hurriedly covered when we came in. Is she thinking about them now, just like I\u2019m thinking about my own obsessions?  \\--  _This article was is an edited version of one first published by Wellcome on __Mosaic__ and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence._  _Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0_**_Facebook_**_, or follow us on _**_Twitter_**_._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0_**_sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter_**_, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

The sound of metal crunching,\u201d says George Larson, a passenger on Indian Airlines Flight 440\u00a0from Chennai (Madras) to New Delhi in 1973. It was 22:30 \u2013 pitch black outside. A storm was raging, and the plane was flying low.  The rear end slammed into the ground first. Larson was thrown from his seat. Meanwhile, the plane kept moving. Electric cables sparked and fellow passengers screamed as the fuselage began to split in half.  The next thing Larson knew he was awake, lying on his back on some wreckage. He tried to move his legs, but he was stuck. Soon there was an explosion as the heat ignited fuel tanks by the wings.  As debris rained down all around him, Larson realised he\u2019d have to save himself. With one last breath \u2013 \u201cit seared my lungs, the air was so hot\u201d \u2013 he pushed off the wreckage and rolled down onto the ground. Then he clawed his way to safety. Of 65 passengers and crew on board, Larson was one of just 17 survivors.  Larson was actually extraordinarily lucky. A few minutes earlier, he had done something ill-advised. He was sitting on the back row, chatting to the flight attendant next to him. Though the seat belt signs were on, he undid his. \u201cNo rhyme, no reason, I just did,\u201d he says. The majority of people who unbuckle before a plane crash don\u2019t survive.  However, after the crash, Larson also had the quick thinking and grit to claw himself to safety before the fire spread.  Surprisingly, plenty of other people in deadly scenarios don\u2019t act fast enough to save their own lives. From arguing over small change while a ship sinks into stormy water, to standing idly on the beach as a tsunami approaches, psychologists have known for years that people make self-destructive decisions under pressure. Though news reports tend to focus on miraculous survival, if people escape with their lives it\u2019s often despite their actions \u2013 not because of them.  \u201cSurvival training isn\u2019t so much about training people what to do \u2013 you\u2019re mostly training them not to do certain things that they would normally think to do,\u201d says John Leach, a psychologist at the University of Portsmouth who survived the King\u2019s Cross fire disaster in 1987. He estimates that in a crisis,\u00a080-90% of people respond inappropriately.  Footage of the Japanese earthquake in 2011 showed people risking their lives while rushing to save bottles of alcohol from smashing in a supermarket. And when a plane caught fire at an airport in Denver earlier this year, evacuating passengers lingered by the plane to watch the flames and take selfies.  Intelligence doesn\u2019t come into it \u2013 the brain fog that descends in emergency situations is reassuringly even-handed. Back in 2001, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge was kayaking in the rough seas off the Isle of Wight when he capsized.  Though he had a mobile phone on board, he clung helplessly to the upside-down boat for more than 20 minutes before he remembered. When he finally retrieved it, first he called his sister in Cambridge \u2013 then his father who was more than 5,000km (3,436\u00a0miles) away in Dubai. He was eventually rescued when his clear-headed relatives alerted the Coast Guard.  So, if faced with a life-threatening scenario, what behaviours should you do your best to avoid?  **1\\. FREEZING**  When we think of disaster, we tend to think of mass hysteria. In the movies at least, people run away with their arms flailing. But the reality is the most natural human response in the face of danger is to simply do nothing.  During the recent stabbing at London Bridge, an off-duty police officer who tackled the attackers reportedly described members of the public nearby as standing \u201clike deers [sic] in the headlights\u201d.  The reaction is so universal, psychologists now talk of the fight-flight- freeze response.  Though it looks passive from the outside, when we\u2019re paralysed with fear the brain is actively putting on the brakes. As adrenaline surges through the body and our muscles tense, the primitive \u201clittle brain\u201d at the base of our necks sends a signal to keep us rooted to the spot.  It\u2019s the same mechanism across the animal kingdom, from rats to rabbits, where it\u2019s a last-ditch attempt to stop a predator from spotting us. But in a disaster, fighting this hangover from our days out on the savannah is vital to survival.    * In 2015, Michael Bond wrote an in-depth article for BBC Future on why people freeze. Read more here.  **2\\. INABILITY TO THINK**  The first clues that our brains tend to go into meltdown under stress came from an alarming discovery.  During the Gulf War in the early 1990s, Israel was bracing itself for attack from Iraq. Following the extensive use of poison gas by the Iraqi army in the 80s, the Israeli government prepared for the worst. Gas masks and auto- injectors carrying the antidote to nerve gas were distributed to the entire population. Israeli families were instructed to select a sealed \u201csafe\u201d room in their homes. On the sounding of an alarm, the public should retreat there \u2013 then put on their gas mask.  Between 19 and 21 January, there were 23 attacks. In all, more than 11,000kg (nearly 13 tonnes) of high explosives were dropped on the densely-populated city of Tel Aviv.  Though no chemical weapons were used, more than a thousand people were injured. But not in the way you might think. A closer look at the hospital admissions revealed that just 234 (22%) of the casualties had been directly harmed by an explosion. The vast majority \u2013 more than 800 people \u2013 had occurred in the absence of any danger. They had occurred during one of several false alarms.  This included 11 cases of death, seven of which were caused by putting on a gas mask and then forgetting to open the filter. Hundreds of people had injected the antidote to the nerve gas though they hadn\u2019t been exposed. Another 40 (mostly sprains and fractures) had occurred while the victim was rushing to the sealed room.  What was going on?  Even at the best of times, our brains are disconcertingly slow \u2013 while disasters are rapid. As part of the certification process, aeroplane manufacturers are required to show that the entire plane can be evacuated in just 90 seconds, since studies have shown that the risk of the cabin being consumed by fire sharply increases after this time. Meanwhile, most of us are still fumbling with our seatbelts.  It all comes down to the way we make decisions. Take chess. A typical chess master\u2019s vocabulary includes around 50,000 moves \u2013 if the knight is on square x, do y \u2013 so the first few moves of a game can be over in mere seconds. But as the game progresses, the more possible positions there are for the pieces on the board. For example, after four moves apiece, there are more than 288 billion combinations.  After a while, players can no longer rely on pre-programmed strategies and must think up their own instead. Then the games slow down a lot. While the first few moves may take seconds, a typical game of pro chess (around 40 moves) takes more than an hour and a half.  This is because actively inventing a new strategy is reliant on working memory, which is responsible for temporarily holding information while we make decisions. \u201cThe brain has a very limited capacity for processing new information,\u201d says Sarita Robinson, a psychologist at the University of Central Lancashire.  In a disaster, the speed at which we think through our options goes from bad to worse. The brain\u2019s first port of call is to flood with the \u201cfeel good\u201d hormone dopamine. This may seem counter-intuitive, but though it\u2019s usually associated with reward pathways, dopamine also plays a crucial role in preparing the body to face danger. It triggers the release of more hormones, including adrenaline and the stress chemical cortisol. And this is where it gets messy.  This cocktail of hormones shuts down the prefrontal cortex, which sits behind the forehead and is responsible for higher functions such as working memory. Just when we need our wits the most, we become forgetful and prone to making bad decisions.  **3\\. TUNNEL VISION**  In a crisis, it\u2019s reassuring to think that we\u2019d respond by creatively thinking our way around the problem. But \u2013 you guessed it, it\u2019s the opposite. A typical response to disaster is so-called \u201cperseveration\u201d \u2013 attempting to solve a problem in a single way, again and again and again, regardless of the results. This happens so often, it\u2019s informed the design of seatbelts in light aircraft.  Because people are used to looking for their seatbelts around their hips, in an emergency that\u2019s the only place they look. Previous designs used to involve a buckle higher up, but in the panic of a crash-landing, people just couldn\u2019t handle it. Other incidents have shown that in a crisis, pilots tend to become obsessed with one item of equipment or response.  Intriguingly, this tunnel vision is also seen in those who have permanently damaged their prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the brain\u2019s stress response switching off this region might be to blame for inflexible thinking in moments of crisis.  **4\\. STAYING STUCK IN ROUTINE**  Which leads us to the next big stumbling block. \u201cThe number of people who have been killed going back to get their wallet from their house, or checking if they\u2019ve left the oven on\u2026\u201d says James Goff, a specialist in disaster and emergency management at the University of Hawaii. After years of working with the public to increase awareness of tsunamis in high risk areas, he\u2019s seen his fair share of unbelievable reactions to a crisis.  On the face of it, risking your life for your wallet seems like madness or sheer stupidity. But it\u2019s extremely common \u2013 so common that survival psychologists have a word for it: \u201cstereotypical behaviour\u201d. In animals, the term refers to repetitive and apparently useless routines, such as pacing back and forth in a zoo.  In humans, it refers to the disconcerting phenomenon of continuing with everyday routines, even when, for instance, your home is on fire. \u201cWhen you leave your house you grab your wallet \u2013 you don\u2019t even think about it. It\u2019s automatic,\u201d says Goff.  When Emirates Flight 521 crash-landed at Dubai International Airport last year, footage emerged of passengers scrambling around the smoke-filled plane to collect their bags from the overhead lockers. Fortunately, no passengers were killed as a result (though sadly one firefighter died tackling the blaze). It wasn\u2019t just a one off \u2013 the same thing happened a year earlier. And again in 2013.  So why can\u2019t we turn these unconscious reflexes off?  It turns out that in everyday life, our brains are extraordinarily reliant on familiarity. In non-disaster scenarios, mindlessly fetching our bag when the plane lands is thought to help free up mental space to focus on stuff we\u2019ve never encountered before \u2013 such as navigating an airport in a foreign city. \u201cWe\u2019re in the present but we\u2019re looking to the future by routine,\u201d says Leach.  New situations are extremely mentally taxing, as we work to build up a new model of the world around us \u2013 a fact which may explain why we tend to feel so tired when we\u2019re abroad or first start a new job. In an emergency, adjusting to the new situation can be more than our brains can take. Instead, we tend to just press on as though nothing is happening.  **5\\. DENIAL**  At the extremes, this extends to completely ignoring the danger altogether. \u201cInvariably over 50% of the population do it, they go down to the sea to watch the tsunami,\u201d says Goff. He has photographs of people watching the Indian Ocean tsunami on Boxing Day in 2004, taken by a person who was racing to get to high ground.  According to Robinson, denial usually happens for two reasons; either because they fail to interpret the situation as dangerous, or because they simply don\u2019t want to. The latter is extremely common in the event of a wildfire, since often evacuating your home means consigning it to ruin.  \u201cPeople tend to wait until they can see the smoke \u2013 and this often means it\u2019s too late to leave. So they\u2019re trapped in a house that is not well prepared for bush fires, or risk being burnt trying to evacuate,\u201d says Andrew Gissing, an expert in emergency risk management at consulting firm Risk Frontiers.  For decades, scientists have known that most of us are terrible at calculating risk. When the stakes are high, our brains tend to rely more on feeling than fact, banishing stressful thoughts and reassuring ourselves by explaining away the danger. This may explain why cancer patients wait four months on average before getting their symptoms checked by a doctor, or why after the 9/11 attacks, people on the upper floors of World Trade Center waited an average of five minutes before they started to evacuate.  One person who has experienced denial of the realities of a disaster first- hand is Yossi Hasson. In 2004, he and his girlfriend were scuba diving in Thailand when the Boxing Day tsunami struck. They were underwater, several miles out at sea when it hit \u2013 \u201csuddenly I felt as if I had been pushed, hard \u2013 then I couldn\u2019t really control anything anymore\u201d \u2013 and later returned to the island.  Though the entire seafront was a panorama of destruction, with rubbish and bodies floating all around the boat, Yossi found himself asking if they could go back to the hotel to fetch their luggage. \u201cThe boat driver was like, \u2018guys, your hotel probably doesn\u2019t exist'\u201d.  **WHAT YOU _SHOULD_ DO IN A DISASTER**  At this point you\u2019re probably wondering \u2013 if we can\u2019t rely on our natural instincts, what should we count on?  For Goff, surviving a natural disaster is about having a plan. \u201cIf you know what you\u2019re doing in advance and you start early, you can usually get away from a tsunami,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it might be a bit hairy.\u201d  Leach has years of experience training the military to escape an eclectic mix of chilling scenarios, from hostage crises to helicopters which have crashed into water (top tip: stay in your seat until the fuselage has flooded and turned upside down, then slip out at the last minute to avoid getting caught in the still-turning rotor blades). He knows that the best way around the mental fallout is to replace unhelpful, automatic reactions with ones that could save your life. \u201cYou have to practise and practise until the survival technique is the dominant behaviour,\u201d he says.  **...BUT SOMETIMES LUCK MATTERS MOST** \u00a0  And what of Larson, survivor of Indian Airlines Flight 440? In the end, the biggest peril for this survivor wasn\u2019t the disaster itself, but what happened afterwards. Eventually he was found by some local villagers who took him to hospital. The fire had been so close by the time he escaped, it singed off the hair on one half of his head. He emerged with first and second degree burns, a broken pelvis, a \u201cbusted\u201d arm and damage to his bladder.  To make sure he didn\u2019t have any other internal injuries, his doctors performed exploratory surgery. Weeks later, he had lost weight and the wound still wasn\u2019t healing. On a hunch, Larson\u2019s chiropractor back in the US cut through the stiches and reached in with his forceps. \u201cHe pulled out this 30-day old, rolled up gauze that is 12in long.\u201d It was a fortunate discovery \u2013 if it had stayed in, his prospects would not have been good.  Preparation, acting fast, busting routines and avoiding denial may all be ways to live a bit longer in worst-case scenarios \u2013 but as Larson\u2019s experiences suggests, sometimes you need a good dose of luck too.  _Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0_**_Facebook_**_, or follow us on _**_Twitter_**_._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0_**_sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter_**_, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

The final ruling, expected on Tuesday, follows a three-year probe into Apple's Irish tax affairs, which the EU has previously identified as illegal.  The Financial Times reports that the bill will be for billions of euros, making it Europe's biggest tax penalty.  Apple and the Irish government are likely to appeal against the ruling.  Under EU law, national tax authorities are not allowed to give tax benefits to selected companies - which the EU would consider to be illegal state aid.  According to EU authorities, rulings made by the Irish government in 1991 and 2007 allowed Apple to minimise its tax bill in Ireland.  Image copyright AP Image caption EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager is leading the probe into Apple's tax affairs  Apple's company structure enabled it to legally channel international sales through Ireland to take advantage of that tax deal.  On Tuesday EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is expected to give an estimate of how much Apple will have to pay back.  But it will be up to Irish authorities to calculate the exact amount.  ## US warning  The investigation into Apple and similar probes into other US firms have been criticised by US authorities.  Last week the US Treasury Department said the European Commission was in danger of becoming a \"supra-national tax authority\" overriding the tax codes of its member states.  Brussels was using a different set of criteria to judge cases involving US companies, the US Treasury warned, adding that potential penalties were \"deeply troubling\".  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p04696h4.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionNobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz says the EU is telling big corporations: \"We can get you.\"  BBC North America technology reporter Dave Lee says that the US Treasury is concerned that if there is a big EU tax bill for Apple, as expected, then Apple will offset at least some of that against the tax it would be paying in the US.  \"So it's essentially shifting billions of dollars from the US economy, from the US tax-pot, into Europe. The US says Europe simply doesn't deserve that money, because all the hard work that goes into creating the iPhone and other Apple products... takes place in the US, and not in Europe.\"  Apple is not the only company that has been targeted for securing favourable tax deals in the European Union.  Last year, the commission told the Netherlands to recover as much as \u20ac30m (\u00a325.6m) from Starbucks and Luxembourg was ordered to claw back a similar amount from Fiat.  Apple is potentially facing a much bigger bill, but with cash reserves of more than $200bn (\u00a3153bn), the company will have little problem paying up.  Nevertheless, Apple may have to restate its accounts following the ruling.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple currently has a stock market value of around $600bn  * * *  ## Analysis: Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter  The current focus is on the size of the bill - how much the European Commission thinks Apple should pay Ireland in back taxes. That will be big enough, but there are even larger issues at stake, including one fundamental question - who really runs the world, governments or giant corporations?  At present, it is difficult to tell. Individual governments appear impotent in their attempts to apply their tax laws to multinationals like Apple. They have systems designed to deal with the movement and sale of physical goods, systems that are useless when companies derive their profits from the sale of services and the exploitation of intellectual property.  In Apple's case, 90% of its foreign profits are legally channelled to Ireland, and then to subsidiaries which have no tax residence. At the same time, countries can scarcely afford not to co-operate when Apple comes calling; it has a stock market value of $600bn, and the attraction of the jobs it can create and the extra inward investment its favours can bring are too much for most politicians to resist.  There is an echo here of the tycoons of the early 20th Century who bestrode America. Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Rockefeller were judged so powerful that they were almost above the law, something that successive US administrations sought to curb.  The European Commission's attempt to bring Apple to heel is on the surface about tax, but in the end about the power of the multinational and the power of the state. There is more to come; Margarethe Vestager, the Danish commissioner who is leading the charge against Apple, is warming up to take on Google.  Europe versus the giants of corporate America will be a battle royale, and one that will run and run.", "newsHeadline": "Apple facing record bill for Irish tax - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37216176", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "Luxembourg", "Belgium", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Ahmed Mansoor](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/123E3/production /_90932747_eb00416d-0f27-40e7-9192-cf6afd41fa72.jpg) Image copyright AP Image caption The texts had been sent to human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor  Flaws in Apple's iOS operating system have been discovered that made it possible to install spyware on a target's device merely by getting them to click on a link.

Apple has since released a software update that addresses the problem.  The two security firms involved, Citizen Lab and Lookout, said they had held back details of the discovery until the fix had been issued.  ## Rare attack  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p045xcgg.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionHuman rights lawyer tells BBC's Today about the hack attempt  The lawyer, Ahmed Mansoor, received the text messages on 10 and 11 August.  The texts promised to reveal \"secrets\" about people allegedly being tortured in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s jails if he tapped the links.  Had he done so, Citizen Lab says, his iPhone 6 would have been \"jailbroken\", meaning unauthorised software could have been installed.  \"Once infected, Mansoor's phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone's camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,\" said Citizen Lab.  \"We are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as part of a targeted attack campaign, making this a rare find.\"  The researchers say they believe the spyware involved was created by NSO Group, an Israeli \"cyber-war\" company.

Researchers were alerted to a vulnerability, investigated it, and made Apple, the company responsible for fixing it, aware so it could issue a fix. Apple, to its credit, understood the severity and acted quickly - it took them just 10 days.  These types of vulnerabilities are rare and extremely lucrative. A genuine \"zero day\" - the name given to previously unknown security flaws - can be sold for upwards of $1m when it affects a major piece of software like Apple's iOS. In this case, it looks like several zero days were combined to make a hugely sophisticated attack package.  Now attention is shifting to the secretive organisation said to be behind the attack, the NSO Group, described by researchers as a cyber arms dealer, and described by itself as firm capable of being a \"ghost\" on victims' devices - working undetected but gathering enormous amounts of private data.  According to Privacy International, NSO Group has sold its products to clients in Mexico and in Panama - but little is known about other deals involving the company which is said to be worth more than $1bn.  Pressure is also being put on Francisco Partners Ltd, the San Francisco-based venture capital firm that has a controlling stake in NSO Group. It is yet to comment on the controversial attack.  * * *  NSO has issued a statement acknowledging that it makes technology used to \"combat terror and crime\" but said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents and made no reference to the specific spyware involved.  \"These are rather rare zero-day flaws,\" commented security expert Prof Alan Woodward, referring to the technical name for previously unknown vulnerabilities.  \"To have several found at once is even rarer. As can be seen from how these have been exploited to date, it represents a serious threat to the security and privacy of iOS users.  \"Apple has been remarkably responsive in providing fixes for these issues, so I would encourage any iOS users to update to the latest version of the operating system.\"  For its part, Apple has limited itself to saying: \"We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5.

The decision follows reports in the US and South Korea of the phone \"exploding\" during or after charging.  The South Korean company said customers who had already bought the phone would be able to swap it for a new one.  Samsung said it had been difficult to work out which phones were affected among the 2.5 million Note 7s sold.  \"There was a tiny problem in the manufacturing process, so it was very difficult to figure out,'' the president of Samsung's mobile business Koh Dong-jin told reporters.  \"It will cost us so much it makes my heart ache. Nevertheless, the reason we made this decision is because what is most important is customer safety,\" he said.  The firm said it would take about two weeks to prepare replacement devices.

The recall comes just one week ahead of an expected presentation of a new iPhone model from its main rival Apple.  What makes lithium batteries catch fire?  * * *  ## Analysis: Zoe Kleinman, BBC technology reporter  This is an extraordinary decision for a tech giant to make based on so few reported incidents - Samsung says it is aware of only 35 cases worldwide.  It's bad timing so soon after a big product launch and especially given that Samsung's rival Apple is understood to be preparing to unveil a new iPhone.  However, the firm says it has discovered a problem with the battery cell and is halting sales while it inspects its suppliers.  People who have already bought the device - which is only available to pre- order in the UK - will be issued with a replacement.

The Galaxy Note 7 model is the latest of Samsung's series of so called phablets - smartphones with very large screens.  Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which lets users unlock the phone by detecting patterns in the eyes.

America's top prosecutor said he did not lie when he testified at a January confirmation hearing that he had \"no communications with the Russians\".  But Democrats are demanding he resign after it emerged he met Moscow's envoy during last year's White House race.  Claims of Kremlin interference have dogged President Donald Trump.  \"I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States,\" Mr Sessions said in a statement.  In a news conference at the Department of Justice in Washington DC, he said his comments at his confirmation hearing were \"honest and correct as I understood it at the time\".  ## What's Mr Sessions accused of?  During the Senate hearing on 10 January, Mr Sessions was asked: \"If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government, in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\"  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump opponents have mocked his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin  Mr Sessions responded: \"I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians. And I'm unable to comment on it.\"  However, it has emerged Mr Sessions and Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, held a private conversation in Mr Sessions' office in September and spoke at a meeting with several other envoys, on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in July.  The former Alabama senator had meetings with more than 25 foreign ambassadors in the course of the year.  His meetings with Mr Kislyak came while he played a prominent part of Mr Trump's campaign team - the so-called surrogate - and amid growing reports of Russian meddling in the US election.  Mr Kislyak is the ambassador who was at the centre of the downfall of Mr Trump's National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn.  Mr Flynn was fired last month after he misled the White House about his conversations with the Moscow diplomat, allegedly regarding US sanctions.  ## What did he talk about with the envoy?  Image copyright AP Image caption Russian envoy Sergei Kislyak was at the centre of the scandal that brought down Mike Flynn  At Thursday's news conference, Mr Sessions said he had spoken with the Russian ambassador as a US senator and not as Mr Trump's surrogate.  He said: \"I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign.\"  Mr Sessions said that during his conversations with the Russian ambassador, he told Mr Kislyak he had once been to Russia with a church group in 1991.  Mr Sessions said they went on to talk about terrorism and then \"somehow the subject of Ukraine came up\".

It was an encounter proposed by a British music publicist and allegedly arranged by an Azerbaijani-Russian businessman, whose pop star son once featured Mr Trump Sr in a music video.  Feeling lost? Here are the key players explained.  * * *  ## Donald Trump Jr  Image copyright Reuters  The centre piece of it all is Donald Trump's eldest son from his first marriage to Ivana, who is now executive vice-president of the Trump Organization.  Here is how it unfolded: he received an email from British music publicist Rob Goldstone promising documents from Russia that would incriminate Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  The meeting with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was allegedly arranged by Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, whose son Emin is a pop star who was managed for a time by Mr Goldstone (more on all of them later).  One email from Mr Goldstone said the information they had been promised was \"obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump\".  Mr Trump Jr's response to it was: \"If it's what you say I love it\".  The meeting took place in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York. When news of it emerged, he denied that the meeting had anything to do with the campaign (we explain what he said below).  He then told Fox News Ms Veselnitskaya had provided them with nothing of use and it had only lasted 20 minutes.

He also serves as the president's lead adviser on relations with China, Mexico and Canada.  He has yet to comment on the case.

But Politico website, citing an unidentified source close to him, said that Mr Manafort had not read the email exchanges to the end on his phone and that he had not even known who was going to be in the meeting.  * * *  ## Natalia Veselnitskaya, Russian lawyer  Image copyright AFP  Known for her campaign against the Magnitsky Act, which enables the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations. In reaction to this controversial act, Russia barred Americans from adopting Russian orphans.  Mr Trump Jr had initially said the discussion of this ban was the subject of their meeting. That was before his email exchange with Mr Goldstone was revealed.  Ms Veselnitskaya was married to a former deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region, the New York Times says. Her clients included state-owned companies and a senior government official's son, whose company was under investigation in the US when the meeting took place.  Her work and connections had drawn the FBI's attention, an unnamed former senior law enforcement official was quoted by the Times as saying.  She told the paper: \"Nothing at all was discussed about the presidential campaign... I have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government.\"  Trump-Russia inquiry: How did we get here?

The publicist has worked closely with world-renowned stars such as Michael Jackson, BB King and Richard Branson. But, despite all of those big names, he was little known to the world until now.  Mr Goldstone's posts on social media suggest he has spent several days in Russia and Azerbaijan on different trips in recent years, including in the months before last year's US presidential election.  Media outlets report that shortly after Mr Trump's win, he posted a picture on his Instagram account in which he wore a T-shirt with \"Russia\" in big letters on it. The account was made private after the reports emerged.  He is a former journalist - media reports say he used to work in tabloids. Most recently, he managed pop star Emin Agalarov.  He has not commented.  Why is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?  * * *  ## Aras Agalarov, billionaire  Often called the \"Donald Trump of Russia\", with an estimated fortune of about $1.9bn (\u00a31.4bn), according to Forbes.  Born in Baku, Azerbaijan, he is the owner of Crocus Group, a major Russian property development company, and was Mr Trump's business partner in taking the Miss Universe competition to Moscow in 2013.  He was also working to partner with Mr Trump in bringing Trump Tower to Russia, a project that never materialised. Crocus, meanwhile, is currently building two stadiums in preparation for the 2018 World Cup hosted by Russia.  Reacting to the news, the billionaire denied any intention to damage Mrs Clinton.  \"These are just fantasies! I do not know who invents them and what Hillary Clinton has to do with it. I do not know, I don't even properly know Rob Goldstone.

In 2006, he married Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev's daughter, Leyla. The couple had two boys and adopted a girl, but have since divorced.

Did he commit a crime?  Donald Trump Jr was joined at his 9 June 2016 meeting with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya by then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner.  In an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity on Tuesday night, Mr Trump Jr insisted Ms Veselnitskaya provided nothing of value.  But legal scholars say that whether or not the interaction was productive in Mr Trump Jr's mind is immaterial, and he could have committed a serious federal offence.  ## What laws could have been broken?  Many legal commentators say Mr Trump Jr's correspondence with Rob Goldstone, who set up the meeting, and the subsequent meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya possibly constitutes a violation of US campaign statute.  Specifically, Section 30121 of Title 52 of federal campaign law, which deals with \"contributions and donations by foreign nationals\".  \"It is illegal for a foreign government or a foreign national to give something of value to a candidate or campaign,\" says Nathaniel Persily, an election law expert and professor at Stanford Law School.  \"It is also illegal for a foreign national and a foreign government to spend money in connection with a federal election.\"  The law prohibits foreign nationals from providing \"a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value\" to American federal, state and local election campaigns.  However, whether or not damaging information about Mrs Clinton, the former Democratic presidential candidate, could be considered a \"thing of value\" is a legal grey area, according to Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School, and will be key to any future legal consequences for Mr Trump Jr.  \"Is providing information covered by this? That's not clear,\" says Professor Briffault. \"I don't know if there's any specific rule or past case that includes information itself.\"  ## Could any other laws have been broken?  According to Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for George W Bush, if Mr Trump Jr knew that the Russians were engaged in hacking and that the information he was seeking was obtained by these means, he could have violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  \"It's like going into a store to buy goods you know are stolen,\" he says.  The 9 June 2016 meeting took place after the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails, but before the hack was made public.  Additionally, if Mr Trump Jr made any misleading or false statements to federal investigators about his contact with Russian representatives, he could face felony criminal charges.  Mr Trump Jr has yet to testify under oath publicly on these matters. But it is possible that behind the scenes, he has given interviews to US intelligence agents or signed sworn statements in the course of the campaign and his father's presidency.  All of that is yet to be determined.  \"It clearly cries out for further investigation,\" says Professor Briffault.  ## Is this treason?  Former Clinton running mate Senator Tim Kaine told CNN that the investigation is \"moving into perjury, false statements, and even into potentially treason\".  But Professor Briffault played that down.  \"Treason strikes me as a little over the top,\" he says.  Richard Painter, the Bush administration ethics lawyer, has used the term in interviews, but said that because we are not at war with Russia, the treason statute likely would not apply.  \"In situations where we don't have a declared war we use other statutes to prosecute conduct,\" he says.  Jonathan Turley, professor of public interest law at George Washington University, has strenuously pushed back on the idea this is treason, or a violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits US citizens from meddling in disputes between the American government and foreign nations.  \"[The Logan Act] has never been used to convict a single US citizen and is widely viewed as facially unconstitutional,\" wrote Professor Turley in The Hill.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald Trump Jr with his father after he accepted the Republican presidential nomination in July 2016  ## So what about 'collusion'?  There are many legal experts - Vox found 12 \\- who believe that the emails prove \"collusion\". However, collusion simply means that two parties were willing to work together in secret, and is not a prosecutable offense. Many lawyers and scholars are pleading with journalists to stop using what they say is a legally useless term.  \"We're talking about 'collusion' as a kind of a catch-all for what are specific, potential crimes,\" says Professor Persily.  There are, however, laws against \"conspiracy\", defined by former federal prosecutor Andrew C McCarthy in the Washington Post as \"an agreement to commit a concrete violation of law\" between two or more parties.  Based on what is currently public, it is unclear whether or not a conspiracy charge would apply here.  \"To rise to the level of conspiracy, there would need to be proof, for example, that a) violations of U.S. law were orchestrated by the Russian regime, and b) Trump campaign officials knew about them and were complicit in their commission,\" McCarthy wrote.  ## Whose job would it be to charge Trump Jr?  If Mr Trump Jr were ever to face criminal charges over his conduct, those would come from Robert Mueller, the former FBI director and special counsellor appointed to investigate the Trump campaign's potential ties with Russia.  \"Whether or not Don Jr may have violated the law is something that special counsel Robert Mueller and his talented team will now investigate,\" writes Jennifer Taub, a professor at Vermont Law School, in an email to BBC.  But she cautions that it is much too early to make predictions on whether or not that will occur.  \"This is just one thread that has been pulled. There is so much more to come as this unravels,\" she writes.  Whether or not President Trump himself will be affected rests on the outcome of the ongoing federal investigation.  Still to be determined is the famous question asked during the investigation into the Nixon-Watergate scandal: What did the president know, and when did he know it?", "newsHeadline": "Did Donald Trump Jr break the law? - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40585149", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4B45/production/_96896291_trumpjr_kushner976getty.jpg) Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner at an inauguration ball  The word \"explosive\" doesn't do justice to the details of the emails Donald Trump Jr tweeted out on Tuesday morning.  Calamitous, perhaps? Seismic? Twitterd\u00e4mmerung?  The president's eldest son probably revealed this correspondence because the New York Times was about to publish it, a fourth devastating journalistic wave that was poised to crash on the White House at any moment.  If that's the case Trump Jr's act, while committed in the name of being \"totally transparent\", was akin to shooting oneself in the head to avoid getting shot. He certainly didn't do it to save his own skin.  Here are four of the most remarkable passages of the email chain that will live in infamy - and what it all means.  ## \"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump\"  Trump Jr originally tweeted out the first three pages, leaving out page four, which has all the juiciest bits. It was like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony without Ode to Joy or the 1812 Overture without the cannons.  The above line is clearly the highlight of the page. Rob Goldstone, the music publicist turned international man of mystery, is straight-up telling the presidential son that Russia wants to help his dad.  In the prior paragraph, he details exactly what he says is being offered - \"official documents and information\" about Democrat Hillary Clinton. Several lines later he floats the possibility of sending the incriminating material to Donald Trump the Elder, via his personal assistant, Rhona. (Rhona should probably get her own lawyer, by the way.)  * * *  ## \"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer\"  Setting aside the glaring lack of punctuation, this line in Trump Jr's response to Goldstone's email shows he knows exactly what he's getting himself into.  He's practically drooling at the possibility of being handed documents from the Russian government that incriminate the one person standing between his father and the White House.  What's more, those last few words seem to indicate that Trump Jr also is thinking about when such information could be revealed.  The meeting took place in early June. \"Later in the summer\", the general election campaign was in full swing.  It's when both parties held their national conventions. It is also, incidentally, when the most damaging emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee server - at the behest of the Russian government, according to the US intelligence community - went public via Wikileaks.  * * *  ## \"Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.\"  The lawyer in question - Natalia Veselnitskaya - has asserted that she is not connected to the Russian government, but Goldstone is presenting her to Trump Jr here as a \"government attorney\".  There's always the possibility that Goldstone is blowing smoke Trump Jr's way, trying to make it seem like he's setting up a super-secret meeting that will upend the presidential campaign when actually he's just saying whatever he thinks is necessary to get a meeting that his client, Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, has requested.  In the music business, I suppose, anything goes.  That may not exonerate Trump Jr, but it would relieve the Russian government of culpability, at least in this regard.  * * *  ## \"To: Jared Kushner; Paul Manafort\"  At the very top of the email chain are two names that should be of particular concern to the White House - Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then- campaign chairman Paul Manafort.  Trump Jr had told the New York Times that he had asked the two men to attend the Trump Tower meeting but had not told them what was to be discussed.  This seems to undercut that, because both men probably had the full email chain, including the earlier correspondence discussing the promise of incriminating \"documents and information\" sitting in their in-boxes the day before they attended the meeting.", "newsHeadline": "Four explosive lines in Trump Jr emails - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40560803", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "Russia", "United States", "Canada", "New Zealand"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionJeff Sessions is a former federal prosecutor  President Donald Trump's choice of Senator Jeff Sessions as his attorney general was initially dogged by allegations of past racism.  The controversy has now moved on to meetings Mr Sessions had with the Russian ambassador during Mr Trump's election campaign.  Mr Sessions was one of Mr Trump's earliest supporters in his White House bid. As a key loyalist, he was a senior adviser to the New York tycoon on politics, national security and policy.  He was also a vice-chairman on the Trump presidential transition team.  ## 'Lying under oath'  Mr Trump's campaign was dogged by allegations that some of his team had met with Russian officials and that Moscow had interfered in the election on his behalf.  Mr Sessions was revealed by the Washington Post to have met Ambassador Sergei Kislyak twice, despite telling his January confirmation hearing that he had had no contacts with the Russians during the campaign.  Democrats have accused him of \"lying under oath\" and say he must resign.  Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake  They have also called on him to step aside from an investigation by the FBI - which he oversees as attorney general - into the alleged Russian interference.  Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Sessions met Mr Kislyak twice during the campaign  Mr Sessions insists he \"never met any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign\". Mr Kislyak was one of 25 foreign ambassadors he met as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee last year.  They held a private conversation in Mr Sessions's office in September and had spoken earlier in the summer, along with several other ambassadors, the Post said.  ## The KKK joke  The latest controversy follows that of alleged racist remarks by Mr Sessions in the past, which proved a roadblock in his political career and put him under fresh scrutiny for the attorney general post.  A Senate committee denied Mr Sessions a federal judgeship in 1989 after lawmakers heard testimony that he had used a racial slur.  Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Sessions was an early supporter of Mr Trump  He had also joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were OK until he heard they smoked marijuana.  The Alabama senator told the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation testimony that allegations he had once supported the KKK were \"damnably false\".  Mr Sessions was also accused of calling a black assistant US attorney \"boy\" and telling him to be careful about how he spoke to \"white folks\".  He denied to the committee ever having called the lawyer \"boy\" and insisted he had merely advised him to be cautious about what he said to \"folks\".  Mr Sessions also rejected claims he had labelled the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \"un-American\".  Democrats were outraged when Senator Elizabeth Warren, who opposed Mr Sessions' appointment as attorney general, was silenced by Republicans while trying to read a letter by Coretta Scott King that criticised him.  Writing in 1986, the civil rights activist alleged that he had \"used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters\".  Mr Sessions' supporters deny he is a racist, pointing to his votes to extend the Voting Rights Act and to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks.  ## Immigration 'hoax'  Mr Sessions has spent much of his career fighting immigration battles, ranging from amnesty bills on creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to visa programmes for foreign workers.  Mr Sessions supports limiting legal immigration, arguing that it protects American jobs.  He also backs Mr Trump's plan to build a wall along the US-Mexican border.  In a 2005 Washington Post op-ed, he argued that, \"legal immigration is the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States\".  The government, he argued, should be focused on \"slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together\".  His strident views on immigration were laid out last year in his 25-page manifesto, \"Immigration Handbook for the New Republican Majority\". In the report, he argues immigration was responsible for job losses and welfare dependency.  He called claims by technology entrepreneurs that immigrant workers with elite skills were part of the innovation process a \"hoax\".  ## What's his background?  Born Jefferson Beauregard \"Jeff\" Sessions III, he became Alabama's attorney general before he joined the Senate in 1996.  He sat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee and the Budget Committee.  The lawmaker, who helped Mr Trump craft his foreign policy plan, was one of the few Republicans to come to his defence after he proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US.  Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Sessions shown during his graduating year at Wilcox County High School  When asked if he supported a temporary ban in his hearing, Mr Sessions said he did \"not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States\".  He has backed Mr Trump's amended proposal, now an executive order, banning individuals from countries with a history of terrorism, which is now being challenged in court.  ## Gay marriage opposition  Like many Republicans, Mr Sessions has opposed the LGBT-rights movement, and in particular the legalisation of same-sex marriage.  In 2000 and 2009 he voted against legislation which would expand the definition of a hate crime to include offences based on sexual orientation.  In 2015 after the Supreme Court voted to allow same-sex marriage across the US, he dubbed the decision an \"effort to secularise, by force and intimidation\".  But Mr Sessions testified in Tuesday's hearing he would follow the law of the land on gay rights.  As Alabama's attorney general in 1996, he fought vigorously to prevent an LGBT-rights conference from meeting at the University of Alabama.  He promised to prosecute school administrators under a state law passed in 1992 that made it illegal for public universities to fund a group that promotes \"actions prohibited by the sodomy and sexual misconduct laws\".  When the university pledged to allow the conference to meet, he sought a court order to prevent it, but ultimately the 1992 order was overturned by a federal judge.  ## What about Guantanamo?  Mr Sessions has challenged calls to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and he has also questioned whether terrorism suspects have the right to be tried in civilian courts.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr Sessions said he accepted the law \"absolutely\" prohibits waterboarding.  He also said Guantanamo Bay was a \"safe place\" that fits the purpose of keeping prisoners \"marvellously well\".  ## Gun crime  The National Rifle Association (NRA) applauded Mr Sessions' appointment as America's top prosecutor, saying he would \"make America a safer place by prosecuting violent criminals while protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners\".  Mr Sessions is rated A+ by the group, indicating that he has a pro-gun voting record.  He has previously voted against background checks at gun shows, and in favour of banning lawsuits against gun manufacturers, and allowing firearms in checked baggage on trains.  In a statement at his confirmation hearing he promised a crackdown on gun violence, saying: \"If I am confirmed, we will systematically prosecute criminals who use guns in committing crimes.\"  Many in the law enforcement community have voiced support for Mr Sessions, believing he will be a strong advocate for the police.", "newsHeadline": "Jeff Sessions, Trump's new attorney general dogged by controversy - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38030602", "countriesMentioned": ["Russia", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![US President Donald Trump \\(L\\), former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn \\(C\\) and former FBI Director James Comey \\(F\\).](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C0B1/production/_96092394_35be0260 -502e-4d10-a997-378d6a547cda.jpg) Image copyright Reuters  The news that the president's son, Donald Trump Jr, has admitted meeting a Russian lawyer who promised to reveal damaging material on Hillary Clinton is just the latest twist in a row over the president's potential ties to Russia.

The appointment of Robert Mueller, who headed the FBI for more than a decade, came just over a week after President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey - sparking calls for such a move.  But what is a special counsel? And what will he do?  ## An independent overseer  The special counsel was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. He made the decision as \"acting attorney general\" because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has stepped aside from the Russia inquiry.  Mr Rosenstein said that given the \"unique circumstances\", it was in the public interest for a special counsel independent \"from the normal chain of command\", to lead the investigation.  By placing authority for the probe into the hands of Mr Mueller, the idea is that it will be able to proceed without any interference, including from the White House.  ## OK, but what will he actually look at?  According to Mr Rosenstein's order, he will look into:    * The Russian government's efforts to interfere in the election   * Any links or co-ordination between Russia and Trump campaign-linked individuals   * Any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation  That last point gives him quite a broad remit, with observers suggesting that he will also determine if the president himself has committed any wrongdoing.  \"This is the way we are going to learn about whether there was an obstruction of justice or whether Mr Trump has violated the law in a way that would require action against him,\" Professor Stefan Halper, who served as a White House official in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations, told the BBC.  * * *  ## Read more  * * *  ## What powers does he have?  The special counsel has the powers of a US attorney - meaning he can subpoena records and bring criminal charges.  He can also prosecute anyone who interferes in his investigation through crimes including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses  Image copyright AFP Image caption The job has no time limit - and will be no laughing matter for Robert Mueller (centre)  The special counsel can also ask for his jurisdiction to be widened.  He will not be supervised on a day-to-day basis but the attorney general, or in this case Mr Rosenstein, will be able to request an explanation for \"any investigative or prosecutorial step\" and can decide that any such action does not need to go ahead.  He must notify Congress if such a decision is made.  ## Who will work for him?  The justice department will provide staff that can work for Mr Mueller, and he can also ask for specific people from both inside and outside the department.  He will have to propose a budget in the next 60 days - and update it annually.  ## Who can get rid of him?  As acting attorney general in this matter, only Mr Rosenstein can fire him, and for the following reasons: misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest or for other \"good cause\", including violation of department policies.  However, President Trump could replace his deputy attorney general at any time.  ## Will the public get to read his report?  Not necessarily. When a special counsel's work ends, a confidential report must be provided to the attorney general explaining the decision to lay charges or not.  The attorney general then has to notify Congress and can decide if the report should be made public.  ## What's the difference between a special counsel and a special prosecutor?  The term \"special prosecutor'\" in the US context harks back to the Watergate scandal, when President Nixon's attorney general appointed Archibald Cox to lead an independent investigation.  But there was actually no law defining and regulating such an appointment, which allowed Mr Nixon to later fire Mr Cox. Only later, in 1978, was the Ethics in Government Act passed, which defined the circumstances under which an \"independent counsel\" could be appointed.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Kenneth Starr's investigation of Bill Clinton started with the Whitewater allegations but ended up providing details of his sexual relationship with an intern  This role actually had more independence from the attorney general than the current special counsel position.  But the legal provision regulating it was allowed to expire in 1999 after the controversy of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's wide-ranging investigation into President Bill Clinton, which started as an inquiry into the Whitewater land deal allegations but ended up providing details of his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.  So the titles \"independent counsel\" or \"special prosecutor\" no longer exist.  Instead the justice department has regulations allowing an outside \"special counsel\" to be appointed to investigate a person or matter when it might present a conflict of interest for the department or under other \"extraordinary circumstances\".", "newsHeadline": "Special counsel: What is it and what will Robert Mueller do? - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39961732", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "Maeve Higgins once set herself a task. The Irish-born comedian wanted to see what life would be like if she stopped laughing at things that weren\u2019t funny. Turns out it wasn\u2019t as easy as she thought. \u201cIt was so effing hard,\u201d she says. \u201cLaughter is a lubricant and is expected, and it\u2019s really hard not to do it.\u201d  It\u2019s coming up for 11pm on a bone-chillingly cold Tuesday night in New York. Higgins and her friend Jon Ronson are huddled backstage behind a thick black curtain, mulling over how the latest gig in their monthly stand-up series, _I\u2019m __New Here \u2013 Can You Show Me Around_?, went. They\u2019re pleased. Tonight\u2019s assorted comics went down well with the punters, a youngish, hip crowd who\u2019d braved the bitter weather to sit in a packed, dimly lit venue under a pub \u2013 all in search of some laughs.  The show is loosely predicated on the theme of being bewildered recent arrivals in a new town, as Higgins and Ronson were not so long ago in Brooklyn. Higgins (a virtuoso comic, author and TV personality in her native Ireland) and Ronson (better known as the bestselling author of _The Psychopath Test_ and _The Men Who Stare __at__ Goats_) suggest there\u2019s something particularly special about being part of the shared experience that is live comedy \u2013 that curious alchemy that occurs when people come together specifically to laugh (or not, depending on the quality of the acts).  \u201cIt\u2019s connection,\u201d Ronson says. \u201cThat\u2019s what this show\u2019s about. It\u2019s about us and the audience connecting with each other\u2026 There\u2019s something about being in the same room with somebody, reading each other\u2019s body language, too.\u201d  Higgins nods. \u201cDefinitely. It\u2019s a communal thing; it\u2019s a release.\u201d Perhaps, she says, because audiences tend to be squeezed together in comedy clubs, acts get to be accidental anthropologists and observe at close quarters how individuals interact when exposed to jokes or funny tales. \u201cYou [might] see a couple,\u201d Higgins says, \u201cand you can tell that they\u2019re checking each other\u2019s responses. Like, can I laugh at this?\u201d  Making people laugh has the potential to make the joke teller feel a bit better, too. \u201cThis is perfect for me,\u201d says Ronson of the set-up, an intimate informal space in which the two hosts casually banter and tell stories in between a succession of comedians taking to the stage. \u201cThis is totally a therapy for me, doing this show.\u201d  Comedy is more than just a pleasant way to pass an evening, humour more than something to amuse. They\u2019re interwoven into the fabric of our everyday existence. Whether you\u2019re sharing an amusing story down the pub, making a self-deprecating joke after someone pays you a compliment or telling a dark joke at a funeral, humour is everywhere. But what is it for? And can humour, as comedy, change how we feel, what we think or even what we do?  As an integral part of human interaction, humour has been on the minds of thinkers for centuries. As Peter McGraw and Joel Warner explain in their recent book, _The Humor Code: A global search for what makes things funny_, \u201cPlato and Aristotle contemplated the meaning of comedy while laying the foundations of Western philosophy\u2026 Charles Darwin looked for the seeds of laughter in the joyful cries of tickled chimpanzees. Sigmund Freud sought the underlying motivations behind jokes in the nooks and crannies of our unconscious.\u201d  > Humour is a great way for us to have evolved so we don\u2019t have to hit each other with sticks  One of the most enduring theories of humour arrived courtesy of the philosopher Thomas Hobbes. It asserts that humour is ostensibly about mocking the weak and exerting superiority. While this is clearly the function of some comedy \u2013 anyone who has flinched at a comic\u2019s lame attempt to poke fun at, for example, disability will attest to this \u2013 it\u2019s a relentlessly bleak and far from complete explanation of the purpose of humour.  \u201cMy first thought when I think about humour is it\u2019s a great way for us to have evolved so we don\u2019t have to hit each other with sticks,\u201d says Scott Weems, a cognitive neuroscientist and author.  In his recent book, _Ha! The science of when we laugh and why_, Weems reviews a raft of academic studies, including those that have used scanning to show which parts of the brain respond when we encounter something funny. In the book, he posits a theory: essentially, that humour is a form of psychological processing, a coping mechanism that helps people to deal with complex and contradictory messages, a \u201cresponse to conflict and confusion in our brain\u201d.  This, in part, he says, is why we laugh in response to dark, confusing or tragic events that, on the face of it, shouldn\u2019t be funny at all. Why, for example, would jokes circulate after 9/11 if we weren\u2019t collectively grasping for ways to parse how unsettling and disruptive it was? Humour that is in bad taste or cruelly targeted at particular groups may generate conflict, but, for Weems, humour is our way of working through difficult subjects or feelings.  Over the years, researchers have built a substantial body of evidence that some types of comedy \u2013 including sophisticated satire, which is growing in popularity \u2013 perform a potent social function, from breaking taboos to holding those in power to account. Avner Ziv, who has written numerous books about humour, explores this theme extensively. As he writes in _Personality and Sense of Humor_, \u201ccomedy and satire possess a common denominator in that both try to change or reform society by means of humour. The two forms together constitute the best illustration there is of the social function of humour.\u201d  You don\u2019t have to look hard for examples of comics placing social justice at the centre of their work. New York-based Negin Farsad\u2019s new book, _How to Make White People Laugh_, has been described as \u201cmemoir meets social-justice-comedy manifesto\u201d, and the one-time social policy analyst talks about comedy as a platform for advancing social justice.  For some comedians, it\u2019s not just about getting laughs \u2013 it\u2019s about changing what we think and maybe even what we do. If there\u2019s one comic who really personifies this, it\u2019s Josie Long. A social justice activist and a comedian, Long has a reputation for delightful, optimistic, whimsical humour and nimble storytelling. She\u2019s been doing live comedy since her teens and her latest BBC radio show, _Romance and Adventure_, has been widely lauded.  However, as her career has evolved, she has consciously put social and political topics at the heart of her act. She believes that comedians have a role to play in articulating and challenging some of the most pressing issues of the day.  > Satire is to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted \u2013 Josie Long  \u201cPolitics can leave you beleaguered, plagued, miserable,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that maxim where they say, \u2018Satire is to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted\u2019. That\u2019s why humour was important [to me]. It was a way to be useful for other people.\u201d In her work, Long filters the political realities of contemporary Britain \u2013 especially what she sees as overt injustices by government \u2013 through humour.  It\u2019s vital to understand the job comedy can do in actively providing a counterbalance to bigotry and prejudice as well as understanding the types of humour that reinforce negative stereotypes, she says. \u201cI want to make sure I\u2019m punching up, not punching down.\u201d  There is a \u201cpowerful place\u201d both within the comedy spectrum and society, Long says, for the sort of audacious, disruptive and challenging observations of comics like John Oliver and Stewart Lee, who she admires. That they have a role in contemporary society beyond just making people laugh is undeniable; their work is evidence of the impact comedy can have more widely. \u201cJohn Oliver is in a position where he has more people watching him than commentators,\u201d she says.  \u201cWhatever happens in British society, stand-up immediately begins a process of discussing and reinterpreting it,\u201d says Sophie Quirk, a University of Kent academic and the author of the 2014 book _Why Stand-up Matters_. \u201cThis process necessarily involves more than just an expression of the individual performer\u2019s viewpoint. If we find a joke offensive, we protest by not laughing at it.\u201d  In many ways, Quirk says, the sorts of observations made by comics such as Long are reinforced by her recent academic work, which has involved lengthy interviews with jobbing comics. \u201cI think sometimes the literature ignores [the] fact that comedy does many things,\u201d she says. \u201cJoking socially is a way of bonding with people.\u201d Political comedy, she argues, can foster a sense of shared ideals. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting people together and talking about views that in the broader social context are quite marginal, and we\u2019re all laughing together at those, then you\u2019re kind of affirming them.\u201d  \u201cI think comedy can be a way of passing on nasty ideas,\u201d she says, echoing Long, adding that it\u2019s important to study in what ways humour reinforces or undermines stereotypes.  According to John Fugelsang \u2013 a New York-based political comedian, writer and actor who hosts the radio show _Tell Me Everything_ \u2013 the recent ascendance of political comedy is one of the most fascinating aspects of the role of humour in US entertainment, and in the country\u2019s broader culture, too. While you do sometimes just need something silly to watch, comedy has much greater resonance than it tends to be given credit for.  > The comedy has had to get so good because the news has got so bad  \u201cI think it\u2019s innate that if someone can make you laugh over what a mess everything is, then that person has not just earned your admiration but, on some level, has also earned your trust.\u201d In the case of the USA, he says, the comedy has had to get so good because the news has got so bad. \u201cThis could be the best time ever to be a political comedian, and they may be needed more than ever.\u201d  The best comedians, he argues, are our most effective anthropologists and cultural critics. \u201cPolitical comedy, when done right, is a delivery system for truth.\u201d  British comic Stephen K Amos sells out venues seating thousands, year in, year out, and has successful BBC Radio 4 programmes under his belt. Amos is convinced that when comics consciously tackle pressing or controversial social issues like racism and homophobia, they can reach people on a much more meaningful level than that achieved by briefly lifting someone\u2019s mood. And while it may be difficult to quantify, he says, the social and psychological impact of comedy warrants much greater recognition.  Obviously, some comedy has no overt social goals at all \u2013 it\u2019s not like the bulk of comedians are trying to change the world \u2013 but Amos contends that one of the singular properties of certain comedy \u201cwhen done well\u201d is the freedom to explore ideas in an unconventional or counterintuitive way, to subvert society\u2019s norms.  The research backs this up. Although the role of comedy is to be\u00a0entertaining first and foremost, through interviewing comedians,\u00a0Sharon Lockyer, a sociology lecturer and the director of the Centre for Comedy Studies Research at Brunel University, has identified a number of possible other functions. These include challenging \u201cstereotypes and dominant discourses that marginalise and stigmatise particular individuals\u201d, for example in relation to disability and sexuality.  Amos\u2019s work frequently tackles the issues of race and homosexuality by upending stereotypes. \u201cI don\u2019t do things for shock value,\u201d he says. \u201cI do stuff that matters to me. In the old days it was just about doing jokes. We\u2019ve moved on \u2013 people are talking about things that matter.\u201d  As an example of what comedy can do, Amos tells the story of a teenager who came up to him after a gig that featured Amos relaying his own tale of coming out as gay to his family. \u201cThe lad came up to me and went: \u2018I\u2019m here on my own\u2026 I think I\u2019m gay and I\u2019m going to tell my parents about it tonight.\u2019\u201d In another instance, a woman who brought her \u201cvery grumpy\u201d dad to a gig told Amos that his set had made her father rethink his views on gay people.  > What I\u2019m doing is assisting you to release those chemicals in your body to make you laugh uncontrollably \u2013 Stephen K Amos  \u201cOh my god, when you touch people on that level? What I\u2019m doing is assisting you to release those chemicals in your body to make you laugh uncontrollably. And if that means challenging your preconceived ideas about who I am, great. We can run with that.\u201d  \u201cVery often what comedians can do is use logic to make painful things make sense,\u201d says John Fugelsang. \u201cThey can articulate complicated emotions and arguments by using jokes as a framing mechanism, when just existing in the heart unexamined can be murky and amorphous.\u201d  When it comes to issues like social justice, \u201chumour can be a social corrective,\u201d he says. \u201cWe see this in African American comedy, LGBT comedy, Latino comedy, religious humour, feminist humour. It validates shared experiences, gets us to think more flexibly and reframe situations in this shared experience we call life.\u201d  Similarly convinced of comedy\u2019s potential to change us is Alfie Moore. A cop by profession and also a regular on the BBC, Moore\u2019s day job is a serious one, yet he harnesses his experience of it to push boundaries with his comedy. His stock-in-trade is poking fun at policing and walking \u201ca fine line\u201d between the serious and the silly, deploying jokes to expose nonsensical policies.  People come to his shows with their own ideas about policing, Moore says, but can leave with their perceptions altered about what the job is and how it slots into society. \u201cOne phrase I heard recently was, \u2018If they\u2019re laughing they\u2019re listening\u2019, and I think that\u2019s a powerful quote.  \u201cNobody ever listened to me when I was in the police. I had no influence. I\u2019d never met senior officers and I\u2019d never met my chief constable. Now I\u2019ve been out of the police, lots of people listen to me. The Radio 4 show got 1.4 million listeners per episode. I had chief constables emailing me.\u201d  Liz Carr\u2019s wickedly dark comedy pivots on challenging perceptions. Like Amos, Carr, who is also an actor and writer, says that to regard comedy merely as something frivolous would constitute a failure to comprehend its place in the world. With a career spanning radio, television (she currently stars in the hit drama _Silent Witness_), stand-up and sketch comedy, Carr was one of the pioneers in the flourishing arena of comics with disabilities.  She\u2019s known for repeatedly defying convention: in her comedy she uses language such as \u2018crip\u2019 (short for cripple) that\u2019s ordinarily associated with demeaning disabled people, as a way of reclaiming it. She\u2019s about to ruffle a few more feathers by making a musical comedy about assisted dying, to be performed at London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall in the autumn of 2016. It is, she says, another example of how humour can be trained on even the most sombre of topics and prod people towards rethinking preconceived notions.  \u201cOften we don\u2019t know how to react about things,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an expectation that you shouldn\u2019t laugh at this or at that. I\u2019m thinking about disability [here]. People are, \u2018Oh\u2026 we don\u2019t want to offend anyone.\u2019 So there\u2019s something about, if you can break that down in laughter, it\u2019s like a relief and a release valve.  \u201cJust your presence at any time changes people \u2013 changes interactions\u2026 I just think [comedy] opens people up in a way that I\u2019ve not found any other medium works.\u201d  Social scientist Sharon Lockyer has been studying the connection between comedy and disability. She\u2019s published articles that examine disabled comedians\u2019 views on the British TV comedy industry and on the cultural shift from disabled people being largely targets of comedy to being \u2018comedy makers\u2019.  Lockyer thinks that this shift and other changes, such as disparaging jokes becoming less tolerated, are indicative of wider changes in society. \u201cThe political potential of comedy clearly suggests that comedy is worth taking seriously,\u201d she says.  Our appetite for comedy is growing. The biggest comics \u2013 from Sarah Millican and Michael McIntyre in the UK to Chris Rock and Amy Schumer in the USA \u2013 pull thousands upon thousands into gigs.  Hugely successful performers such as Louis CK and shows like _Broad City_ have distributed their comedy over the internet, and there is a profusion of funny Vines and YouTube clips. Some of the best podcasts are comedic, including Marc Maron\u2019s _WTF_, which gets a reported 5 million downloads a month and an average 450,000 downloads per episode. There\u2019s even a podcast for comedians by a comedian, aptly titled _The Comedian\u2019s Comedian Podcast_.  Academic researchers are also increasingly interested in humour, often being lumped together under the epithet \u2018humorologists\u2019. In 2009, a research lab dedicated to the \u201cscientific study of humor, its antecedents, and its consequences\u201d opened at the University of Colorado Boulder (the Humor Research Lab there is affectionately known as \u2018HuRL\u2019). And in the UK, the Centre for Comedy Studies Research (CCSR) was set up at Brunel University in 2013 to study the social impact of comedy. Then there\u2019s the International Society for Humor Studies (ISHS) and its quarterly journal, _HUMOR__: International Journal of Humor Research_, and the biannual journal _Comedy Studies_.  Peter McGraw, a coauthor of _The Humor Code_ and an expert in emotion and behavioural decision theory at HuRL, was once told by an Ivy League acquaintance that studying humour was a \u201ccareer killer\u201d. But he suggests that because we are likely to experience humour much more often than emotions like fear or regret, studying it has as much academic merit as supposedly more worthy topics.  \u201cPeople pursue [humour] in all these parts of their lives: their entertainment consumption, with their friends and families. And there\u2019s evidence about using it to cope. Another thing I think is an important puzzle \u2013 is that when you try to be funny and you fail\u2026 you can create conflict. You can upset people. You can anger people.\u201d  Only when Sophie Quirk links comedy to an established \u2018serious\u2019 subject, like politics, or to negativity do people think there is any value in it. \u201cJust because it\u2019s fun, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s insignificant,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople think that [studying] fear must be very important. But laughter, the state of being amused \u2013 because it\u2019s fun and exciting, that\u2019s the reason it\u2019s been neglected and that\u2019s really, really odd.\u201d  Research is exploring all kinds of aspects \u2013 from what happens in the brain when we \u2018get\u2019 a joke, to the cardiovascular benefits of a good laugh. It could also shed light on the nature of people who choose comedy as a career. For example, research presented in 2014 suggested that, despite their work, comedians had less activity in brain regions associated with the pleasure and enjoyment of humour compared to everyone else.  \u201cThis generation is when we are going to start seeing people studying humour like they studied intelligence,\u201d Scott Weems tells me. \u201cHumour may be the way of finally getting at what is special about the human condition\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it will be in my lifetime, but we\u2019re getting close.\u201d  On the opposite side of the USA to Maeve Higgins and Jon Ronson, Jamie Masada is brimming with energy. He\u2019s in the heavily upholstered upstairs bar overlooking the stage of the Laugh Factory comedy club on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles. He\u2019s about to host a weekly open mic night where aspiring comics perform three minutes of the best material they can muster. It doesn\u2019t matter that most of them will be rubbish (he\u2019s seen it all in the 30 years he\u2019s run the night) \u2013 at least they\u2019ll have a go at making people laugh.  Masada, who migrated to America from Iran as a teenager, says with complete sincerity that if observing audiences night in, night out has taught him anything, it\u2019s that comedy can have a profound impact on how we feel, and even how we act. He recounts seeing people arrive at comedy clubs looking utterly miserable, but then leaving with a smile on their face, visibly transformed \u2013 married couples that turned up barely speaking leaving holding hands.  \u201cIt\u2019s so fundamental to us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need comedy like air to breathe.\u201d Masada\u2019s ebullience could be read as self-serving (he does run comedy clubs after all), but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not on to something. For many comics there are profound mechanisms at play in their work, especially when the humour veers towards political and wider social issues.  \u201cYou should have a go!\u201d he urges me, with a broad smile on his face. \u201cMaking someone laugh is the greatest power any human being can have!\u201d He isn\u2019t joking.  \\---  _This is an edited version of an article originally published by Mosaic, and is reproduced under a Creative Commons licence._  _Join 600,000+ Future fans by liking us on_\u00a0_**Facebook**__, or follow us on_ _**Twitter**__,_\u00a0_**Google+**__,_\u00a0_**LinkedIn**_\u00a0_and_\u00a0_**Instagram**__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - How comedy makes us better people", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160829-how-laughter-makes-us-better-people", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "Iran, Islamic Republic of", "United States", "Canada", "France", "Australia", "Thailand", "South Africa"], "author": "Mary OHara "},{"newsText": "At the age of six, Jack Craven started telling his mother he wanted to die. \u201cGod made a mistake when he made me,\u201d he would say. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just die?\u201d His mother, Lori Craven, says she didn\u2019t even know that kids his age could think such things: \u201cCan you imagine your child saying that?\u201d  Jack, now 12, has sensory processing disorder (SPD). It\u2019s a contentious diagnosis. Some doctors will argue that it doesn\u2019t really exist, while those who recognise it estimate that sensory issues affect between 5 and 16 per cent of us.  > A caress feels like sandpaper tearing their skin  For some people, this means they are over-sensitive to lights or sounds. But there are others for whom a caress feels like sandpaper tearing their skin, and there are babies who will scream and won\u2019t sleep unless they are held tightly and bolt upright. It can make what many of us take for granted as \u2018normal\u2019 life practically impossible.  As a toddler, Jack had found it unbearable to be anywhere loud: \u201cThere was a lot of screaming if it was noisy,\u201d Lori recalls. \u201cActually, there was just a lot of screaming from him.\u201d At school, \u201che was like a deer in headlights\u201d.  Jack is a bright boy, but the environment was so overwhelming he couldn\u2019t perform well. He would come home and tell Lori that the other kids were saying he was \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201ca dummy\u201d. Now she schools him at home herself. Every day, in everything they do, they have to consider Jack\u2019s sensitivities, she says.  Despite the difficulties, some adults and some parents of kids with SPD report an upside. As well as being more reactive to physical sensations, they\u2019re also more sensitive to other people\u2019s emotions. To researchers, this is intriguing.  Could sensory processing help explain the personalities of people we might otherwise just think of as \u2018sensitive\u2019? Might people with SPD even be at the extreme end of a spectrum of sensitivity that developed as an evolutionary advantage?  \u201cHow am I feeling in this room right now? _Horrible_. This is a terrible room. I\u2019m trying not to focus on the lights and let them bother me. I\u2019m trying not to listen to that echo \u2013 because I\u2019m hearing my voice in my throat, and in the air _and_ bouncing off the walls. And we are sitting with this gap behind us, so I\u2019m floating in the middle of the room and a piece of me is going, \u2018I hope this doesn\u2019t screw me up for when I have to be on stage\u2019\u2026 I guess the door is _locked_? No one\u2019s coming in, right?\u201d  > For Rachel, an echo is as attention-seizing as scraping nails  It\u2019s a little after midday on a bright cold Tuesday in Chicago, and Rachel S Schneider is describing what it\u2019s like for her to be in what to most people would seem a bland ante-room to the hall in which she will shortly be speaking. If being in here is so discomfiting, the flight from New York, where she lives, must have been torture? She nods.  Schneider was diagnosed with SPD in 2010, when she was 27. For her, it means she\u2019s particularly over-sensitive to sights and sounds. No one likes a spotlight in the face or the sound of nails on a blackboard, but to Schneider a glow can feel like a spotlight.  For her, an echo is as intrusive and attention-seizing as scraping nails. She also struggles with a lesser-known sense called proprioception \u2013 the sense of where your body parts are in space. For this reason, she thinks, she enjoys pressure on her body (\u201cI\u2019m a hugger!\u201d).  She\u2019s been hyper since she burst into the room, fuelled by excitement (relating to the symposium she\u2019ll shortly be addressing) and anxiety (relating to her talk, the travel, this interview, this room). When we start talking about recent neurological research into SPD, she practically bangs her fist on the table. \u201cIt was pivotal!\u201d she says. \u201cPIVOTAL! When I first heard about it, I was so excited, I wanted to throw a parade!\u201d She pauses for a moment. \u201cAnd I _don\u2019t _like parades.\u201d  The parade would have been for Professor Elysa Marco at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Marco is a paediatric neurologist and is now regarded as a leading expert on SPD. Go back six years, though, and she hadn\u2019t even heard of it. She was, however, starting to think more about the role of sensory problems in the symptoms of many of her young patients.  In her consulting rooms, she was seeing kids with a range of brain-related difficulties. \u201cWhat I realised was that the families were coming in, and I would want to talk about the kids\u2019 seizures or their headaches or their language problems in the case of, say, kids with autism,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the parents wanted to talk about that also.\u201d  > They couldn\u2019t get a shirt on their kids because they would scream bloody murder  \u201cBut what they really wanted to talk about was the minute by minute, the day by day, which was so hard as they couldn\u2019t get their kids into the shower to wash their hair because the kids wouldn\u2019t let them touch their heads, or they couldn\u2019t get a shirt on them because they would scream bloody murder. Or they couldn\u2019t make soup in the kitchen with the blender because the kid would cover their ears and run out the door.\u201d  In the 1960s, Jean Ayres, an occupational therapist and educational psychologist working in California, first identified SPD (or \u201csensory integration disorder\u201d, as she called it then) as something distinct. For people who accept SPD as a disorder, what unifies patients is that while their sense organs work normally, their brains do not respond typically to the data those organs send on. Some people with SPD are \u201cunder-responsive\u201d (they crave the stimulation of one or more senses), while many are \u201cover-responsive\u201d to one or two senses, or more. Some are under-responsive in some senses and over- sensitive in others.  Lucy Jane Miller was one of Ayres\u2019 students, and has researched SPD for more than 30 years. Now a professor of paediatrics at Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions in Colorado, and the founder of the SPD Foundation, she has developed assessment scales for diagnosis, co-ordinated research into therapies and done all she can to spread the word that SPD exists. But the recognition she has long fought for \u2013 a listing in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or DSM, sometimes called the \u2018bible\u2019 of psychiatrists and psychologists) \u2013 still eludes her.  In the summer of 2008, Miller gave a presentation at the UC Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute about problems with sensory processing. Elysa Marco was in the audience. \u201cIt was as though a big bright light turned on for me,\u201d Marco recalls. \u201cI was very excited. I thought: okay, this is the way I need to think about and study my kids.\u201d  After the talk, she went up to Miller and told her she was already planning a study at UCSF to image the brains of children with autism; perhaps she could use brain imaging to investigate SPD too? Miller helped Marco get the funding she needed, and the research that followed changed Rachel Schneider\u2019s life.  The first experiments, whose results were published in 2013, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the brains of kids with SPD and a group without any disorder. The results showed measurable differences in brain structure, primarily in areas towards the back of the brain that connect regions involved in processing visual, aural and touch data. (A bigger follow- up supporting these findings was published in 2016.)  A second paper, published in 2014, compared children who had SPD with autistic children, because there are overlaps between the two conditions. According to some estimates, as many as 90 per cent of people with autism have sensory processing problems, but Marco wanted to confirm that SPD could also occur without autism.  While there were some similarities, she also found significant differences. The SPD kids had less white matter \u2013 the \u2018wiring\u2019 that connects parts of the brain together \u2013 in some sensory-related regions. Whereas the children with autism had impairments in brain circuits essential for processing the emotions on people\u2019s faces, which the SPD children did not. Or, as Schneider puts it: \u201cThe first study said, \u2018Cool, we established SPD exists\u2019, and now, \u2018Here it is compared to autism, and \u2013 guess what \u2013 it looks different in the brain, guys!\u2019\u201d  > For the first time in my entire existence, there was proof that I am different - Rachel S Schneider  These studies are crucial for Schneider because they provide evidence that SPD is a neurological disorder. She has struggled with her symptoms her whole life, she explains. She\u2019s a warm, friendly, outgoing person, but shrank from family outings as a kid, found it hard to fit in at school because social gatherings like parties were overwhelming, had what she calls \u2018shutdowns\u2019 in the street that were diagnosed as panic attacks, and had to wait until she was 27 even to hear about SPD \u2013 only to learn that it was not well-understood or widely accepted.  Then the brain-imaging studies were published. \u201cFor the first time in my entire existence, there was proof that _I am different._\u201d  There was still resistance to the idea of SPD, however. In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics put out a statement saying: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether children with sensory-based problems have an actual disorder related to the sensory pathways of the brain, or whether these problems are due to an underlying developmental disorder,\u201d such as autism, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) or anxiety disorder. Many paediatricians have remained cautious.  Thomas Boyce, a professor of paediatrics at UCSF, is sceptical but not dismissive: \u201cI think there\u2019s undoubtedly something there,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it may well be that there is a sensory processing disorder\u2026 I just think we don\u2019t understand enough yet.\u201d  Sensory sensitivities are not uncommon in childhood. One survey of parents in the USA found that 16 per cent were \u201cover-responsive\u201d to some form of sensory stimulus, while another found that based on their parents\u2019 responses, at least 5 per cent of school-age kids met the criteria for SPD. \u201cIf you can take your child to the fireworks and they cover their ears and they make it through, then they go home and they are back to normal and everything is fine\u2026 then bring earplugs,\u201d explains Marco_._  \u201cBut if you can\u2019t take them anywhere there might be a popping noise, or every time you vacuum the house they are screaming for hours on end, or you put diapers on them and they scream and claw at their skin, then you cross the line.\u201d  When Jack Craven was 10, his mum Lori took him to see Elysa Marco in San Francisco. They found themselves staying in a rough part of town. \u201cAs soon as we walked out of the hotel, Jack would grab our hands really tight and he was shaking, he was terrified,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t like San Francisco! There are too many sad people!\u2019\u201d  At home, Lori, her husband and their daughter can never react with anything other than warmth to whatever Jack does or says, no matter how hurtful it is. If they react with disapproval, \u201cwe\u2019ve got an explosion on our hands\u201d.  Our senses provide information about our world, including other people. We constantly offer each other visual and auditory clues to our emotional states through our facial expressions, our tone of voice, our posture. Our brains pick up this information instantaneously and subconsciously.  > Volunteers experienced stress watching others undergoing a stressful experience  In one experiment, Tania Singer, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, and a pioneer in the field of social neuroscience, found about a quarter of volunteers experienced a surge in their levels of the stress hormone cortisol just by watching other people undergoing a stressful experience. This is called subconscious emotion contagion.  And if visual and auditory data provide information about someone else\u2019s fear or anger, for example, it doesn\u2019t seem a great leap to think that people with pronounced sensory sensitivities, like Jack, will get more of this information and respond to it more strongly. When Rachel Schneider says \u201csomeone can walk into a room, and right away, I\u2019ll know how they\u2019re feeling, and how I\u2019m going to feel around them,\u201d that fits too.  Emotion contagion is thought to be the basis on which empathy \u2013 an understanding of how someone is feeling and a sharing of their emotion \u2013 is built. There is research suggesting a link: Singer has found that people who are more susceptible to emotion contagion also score higher on empathy questionnaires. She has not studied people with SPD. But Elysa Marco is receptive to the idea that over-responsive SPD kids and adults fall at the extreme end of a spectrum of general sensitivity to the environment that includes other people.  **Extreme orchids**  For her, there\u2019s yet another way of thinking about them: as extreme \u201corchids\u201d.  Ask a non-psychologist what a \u2018sensitive\u2019 person is like, and they might say someone who\u2019s easily hurt by a jibe, who cries at sad (or sometimes happy) moments in movies, who prefers the company of a single friend or a book of poetry to a party. Psychologists don\u2019t define the word in quite the same way (though crying over a film, enjoying poetry and avoiding parties can still fit right in).  At a caf\u00e9 in Tiburon, a quiet town in Marin County, just across the bay from San Francisco, psychologist Elaine Aron is explaining what being a \u201csensitive\u201d person means to her. \u201cThe most important aspect is that they process information more deeply and thoroughly,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things people notice about some of them are the surface behaviours, like being upset by too much noise or crying easily or not liking to be rushed on a decision. But underneath that there is this depth of processing.\u201d  Aron has pioneered the scientific study of the \u201chighly sensitive person\u201d (HSP), which she thinks is a distinct personality type \u2013 underpinned by what she terms \u201csensory processing sensitivity\u201d \u2013 and one that can be identified not only in humans but in over 100 different species of animal.  It\u2019s not the same as introversion (about 30 per cent of the people she has studied are extrovert). But highly sensitive people and animals generally approach situations, including social interactions, more cautiously. They pause and reflect rather than rushing in. They notice more about their environment, and can use that information to help them to survive and, ideally, thrive.  > Perhaps 20 per cent of the population are highly sensitive  Her 27-point checklist, used to find out if someone falls into this category, asks you to tick statements that apply to you, such as \u201cOther people\u2019s moods affect me\u201d, \u201cI make it a point to avoid violent movies and TV shows\u201d, \u201cI seem to be aware of subtleties in my environment\u201d, \u201cI am made uncomfortable by loud noises\u201d, \u201cI am conscientious\u201d and \u201cI make it a high priority to arrange my life to avoid upsetting or overwhelming situations\u201d.  \u201cI think I\u2019d probably tick every one,\u201d Aron smiles. In fact, it was being called \u201csensitive\u201d by a therapist back in 1990 that sparked her curiosity about what that means scientifically.  Based on her work and that of others, she thinks that perhaps about 20 per cent of the population are HSPs, and that within that group there\u2019s a spectrum of sensitivity \u2013 but that the rest of us don\u2019t fall on it. Most of us, she argues, are simply not \u2018sensitive\u2019, and the difference this makes is as big as gender. \u201cHow it impacts people is_ enormous,_\u201d she says.  It isn\u2019t only Aron who divides people into sensitive and non-sensitive types. At UCSF, Thomas Boyce classifies kids as either \u201cdandelions\u201d, who will do pretty much the same anywhere, provided their environment isn\u2019t excessively harsh (about 80 per cent of kids), or \u201corchids\u201d, who are highly sensitive to their environment (the other 20 per cent). Orchids are more \u201cpermeable\u201d, Boyce says, to their surroundings. In difficult environments, they do badly. But in supportive environments, they actually do _better_ than dandelions.  Both Aron and Marco admire this work. Aron thinks Boyce\u2019s orchids are her HSPs, and Boyce agrees. \u201cWhat she sees in her primarily adult patients is very close to what we are seeing in orchid children,\u201d he says.  > There\u2019s an evolutionary benefit to having different psychological types  Aron and Boyce believe there\u2019s an evolutionary benefit to having different psychological types in the population, including HSPs. Those who pay close attention to their environment \u2013 noticing more, taking more in \u2013 will do better in some circumstances, while bold, adventurous, thrill-seeking types will be more likely to succeed in others. The observation of more-sensitive, environmentally-aware and also bold, less-sensitive individuals in a wide range of animals, from birds to fish, supports this idea.  But where do people with SPD fit in? Marco thinks some of her over-sensitive patients sit on the extreme end of the orchid spectrum. Aron is not so sure; her feeling is that they are different in kind. People with SPD who are over- responsive are more distracted by sensory input than able to use it to garner useful information about their environment, she argues. Boyce is not convinced either. While sensory sensitivity is a hallmark of an orchid child, he thinks there are other differences in orchid brain functioning \u2013 differences that mean they process information about their environment more deeply.  Still, Michael Pluess, a senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, who studies the same groups as Boyce but uses the term \u201cenvironmentally sensitive\u201d rather than \u201corchid\u201d, comments: \u201cI would expect that people scoring high on HSP are more likely to also be diagnosed with SPD.\u201d  Once a patient is diagnosed, the next step is treatment \u2013 not to remove the sensitivity, given its potential benefits, but to make living with it less traumatic. At the moment, occupational therapy is often used to design specific programmes depending on the symptoms.  Schneider says that, for example, jumping on the spot and doing push-ups against the wall helps to calm her, as does using a \u201cskin brush\u201d to brush her limbs and torso (she uses such a brush before she sits down with me).  > Treatments can include drugs for anxiety or ADHD  Treatments can also include drugs for anxiety or those used in ADHD, but other options may be on the way. Marco is involved in work on a computer game, called Evo, designed to help train attention. About 40 per cent of kids with SPD also meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, and if you can use Evo to improve someone\u2019s attention to a stimulus, you should be able to improve their ability to process it accurately, Marco argues.  A research study using this game hasn\u2019t yet been published, so she won\u2019t reveal details, but she says \u201cwe\u2019re showing some really nice improvements, and some brain changes\u201d. Jack Craven was one of the kids who took part in the study \u2013 anecdotally, his mother reports big improvements in his ability to take in visual information.  Marco is also investigating the genetics of SPD and how it compares to autism and ADHD. While these are all distinct diagnostic labels, they apply to groups of symptoms that often overlap. It\u2019s easy to see how a child who can\u2019t concentrate at school because her SPD means she\u2019s focusing on the clicking of a fan might get labelled as having attention deficit disorder; or how a child who wants to run around endlessly because he craves sensory input about the location of his body parts in space might get labelled as hyperactive. And it\u2019s simple to understand how a child who cannot properly process visual information about a face might struggle to understand what someone else is thinking and be diagnosed as autistic.  \u201cThere are overlapping genetics for all these brain-based conditions,\u201d Marco says. \u201cThe labels are simply behavioural descriptions.\u201d  For Rachel Schneider, recognising SPD as a distinct disorder is essential, because it would cut the number of people who grow up, as she did, not understanding what is wrong with them \u2013 and being dismissed, or worse, as a result. She is now well-known as an advocate within the SPD community \u2013 she\u2019s written a book, and has a blog and a Facebook page through which many fellow sufferers contact her.  > We decree that sensory issues exist and are worthy of your attention - Sensory Is Real manifesto  These stories from people with SPD, as well as their own experiences, persuaded Schneider and Kelly Jurecko\u00a0\u2013 who runs SPD Parent Zone, an organisation that provides information to parents of SPD kids \u2013 to launch a new initiative called Sensory Is Real. \u201cWe, the people of the Sensory Community, decree that sensory issues exist and are worthy of your attention, understanding and acceptance,\u201d its manifesto says.  When I meet Schneider, she\u2019s in Chicago to talk at an event on how to improve accessibility at places like museums, theatres and zoos for people with sensory processing problems. The large sunlit hall is already packed with representatives from local cultural institutions. She\u2019s waiting nervously in the ante-room, worrying about the disturbing reflections off the hall\u2019s highly patterned marble walls. But she knows that afterwards, her husband Josh (whom she only half-jokingly calls her \u2018handler\u2019) will rub her back in broad circles to help calm her.  \u201cSo many SPD adults have secondary anxiety,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThere are a lot of psychological conditions affiliated with this, because for so long, the sentence in your head is: \u2018I can\u2019t do this, what is wrong with me, I can\u2019t do this, everybody hates me, I\u2019m embarrassing, life is painful and difficult, I can\u2019t do this.\u2019  \u201cSo I\u2019m trying to change the dialogue to: \u2018It\u2019s a little bit difficult, you have to change how you do things\u2026 but _yes_, you can.\u2019\u201d  Then she goes into the hall, overcomes the reflections and the anxiety, and starts to speak.  \\--  _This is an edited version of an article originally published by Mosaic, and is reproduced under a Creative Commons licence._  _Join 600,000+ Future fans by liking us on_\u00a0**_Facebook_**_, or follow us on_ **_Twitter_**_,_\u00a0**_Google+_**_,_\u00a0**_LinkedIn_**\u00a0_and_\u00a0**_Instagram_**_._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The daily pain of having extreme perception", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160617-the-daily-pain-of-having-extreme-perception", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "Portugal", "Italy", "Germany", "United States", "Canada", "Hungary", "South Africa", "France", "Brazil", "Trinidad and Tobago"], "author": "Emma Young"},{"newsText": "On 14 April 2016, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Japan\u2019s southernmost island of Kyushu, toppling buildings and sending residents rushing into the streets. Hundreds of aftershocks \u2013 one an even stronger 7.0 quake \u2013 continued for days, killing 49 people, injuring 1,500 and forcing tens of thousands from their homes.  News spread immediately around the globe on social media.  \u201cEarthquake just happened,\u201d Margie Tam posted from Hong Kong. \u201cR u ok kumamon?\u201d  \u201cAre Kumamon and his friends safe?\u201d wondered Eric Tang, a college student.  \u201cPray for Kumamoto &amp; Kumamon,\u201d wrote Ming Jang Lee from Thailand, a phrase that would be repeated thousands of times.  Kumamoto is a city of 700,000 in a largely agricultural province in south- western Japan.  But what, or more precisely _who_, is Kumamon? And why in the wake of an immense natural disaster did concern for earthquake victims focus on him, specifically?  That\u2019s a bit more complicated.  It is 12 March 2016, one month before the earthquake. Kumamon bounds onto an outdoor stage at the opening event of his birthday party in Kumamoto. About 150 guests \u2013 mostly women \u2013 cheer, clap and whistle.  > He has black glossy fur, circular red cheeks and wide, staring eyes  Kumamon waves and bows. He is about 1.5 metres (5ft) tall, with black glossy fur, circular red cheeks and wide, staring eyes. He\u2019s dressed for the occasion in a white satin dinner jacket trimmed in silver and a red bow tie.  One woman in the crowd holds a Kumamon doll swaddled in a baby blanket. Another has dressed her doll in a grey outfit matching her own. She says it took her a month to sew. A number of fans have pasted red paper circles on their cheeks to mimic his. Those in the first row arrived at 3am to snag their prime spots to greet the object of their intense though difficult-to-explain affection.  \u201cActually, I have no idea why I love him so much,\u201d says Milkinikio Mew, who flew from Hong Kong. She slept in, showing up at 6am for the 10am kick-off, so had to settle for a seat in the last row.  Kumamon is\u2026 well, he\u2019s not exactly a cartoon character, though he does appear in a daily newspaper comic strip. He\u2019s not a brand icon either, like Hello Kitty, though like her, he does not speak and, also like her, his image certainly moves merchandise.  He\u2019s not sexy, but when the Empress Michiko met Kumamon \u2013 at her request \u2013 during the imperial couple\u2019s visit to Kumamoto in 2013, she asked him: \u201cAre you single?\u201d  But what is Kumamon? Well, he\u2019s sort of a\u2026  But first, the big moment is here. A birthday cake is rolled out, and the crowd sings \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019. Then presents. A representative from Honda, which has a motorbike factory nearby, gives him its Kumamon-themed scooter. An Italian bicycle maker unveils a custom Kumamon racing cycle. Plus a new exercise DVD, on which Kumamon leads the workout.  > Kumamon is a yuru-kyara, or \u2018loose character\u2019  The Italian bicycle is not for sale, yet. But the other two items are, joining the more than 100,000 products that feature Kumamon\u2019s image, from stickers and notebooks to cars and aeroplanes (a budget Japanese airline flies a Kumamon 737). When Steiff offered 1,500 special edition Kumamon plush toys at $300 (\u00a3228) each, they sold out online in five seconds according to the German toymaker. Last year Leica created a $3,300 (\u00a32,285) Kumamon camera, a bargain compared to the solid gold statue of Kumamon crafted by a Tokyo jeweller, which retails for $1m (\u00a3761,000).  So what is he then? Kumamon is a _yuru-kyara_, or \u2018loose character\u2019, one of the cuddly creatures in Japan that represent everything from towns and cities to airports and prisons. The word is sometimes translated as \u2018mascot\u2019, but _yuru-kyara _are significantly different from mascots in the West, such as those associated with professional sports teams, which tend to be benign, prankish one-dimensional court jesters that operate in the narrow realm of the sidelines during game time.  Kumamon has a far wider field of operation as the _yuru-kyara _for Kumamoto Prefecture (a prefecture is like a state in the US or a county in England). He has become more than a symbol for that region, more than merely a strategy to push its tourism and farm products. He is almost regarded as a living entity, a kind of funky ursine household god (it is perhaps significant that the very first licensed Kumamon product was a full-sized Buddhist shrine emblazoned with his face). He hovers in a realm of fantasy like a character from children\u2019s literature, a cross between the Cat in the Hat and a teddy bear.  Kumamon has personality. \u201cCute and naughty,\u201d Tam explains, later, when I ask what about Kumamon made her care about him enough to be concerned immediately after the earthquake.  She wasn\u2019t alone. After the April quake, Kumamon\u2019s Twitter feed, which has 494,000 followers and is typically updated at least three times a day, stopped issuing communications.  \u201cPeople are asking why Kumamon\u2019s Twitter account has gone silent when the prefecture needs its mascot bear more than ever,\u201d the Japan Times noted on its Facebook page on 19 April.  Into the vacuum came hundreds, then thousands of drawings, posted by everyone from children to professional manga artists, not only from Japan, but from Thailand, Hong Kong, China. They waged an impromptu campaign of drumming up support for earthquake relief using the bear. Kumamon was depicted leading the rescue efforts, his head bandaged, lifting stones to rebuild the tumbled walls of Kumamoto Castle, propping up tottering foundations, enfolding children in his arms.  \u201c_Ganbatte _Kumamon!\u201d many wrote, using a term that means something between \u2018don\u2019t give up\u2019 and \u2018do your best\u2019.  > Is appreciation for cuteness hardwired in human beings? What does it say about our society?  What is happening here? Kumamon is _kawaii \u2013 _the word is translated as \u2018cute\u2019, but it has broad, multi-layered meanings, encompassing a range of sweetly alluring images and behaviours. Not only does _kawaii _include the army of Japanese mascots, but a world of fashion that has adult women dressing as schoolgirls and schoolgirls dressing as goth heroines or Lolita seductresses, giving rise to _ero-kawaii_,or erotic _kawaii_, a mash-up of cute and sexy.  We eagerly spend fortunes on cute avatars \u2013 Kumamon earned $1bn (\u00a3761m) in 2015, Hello Kitty four or five times that \u2013 without ever wondering: what is cute? What about it causes us to open our wallets and our hearts? Is appreciation for cuteness hardwired in human beings? What does it say about our society? And where do our concepts of cuteness originate?  Babies are our model for cuteness. The big cheeks and big eyes seen in many fictional cute characters are straight out of Konrad Lorenz\u2019s _Kindchenschema_, or \u2018baby schema\u2019, as defined in the Nobel Prize-winning scientist\u2019s 1943 paper on the \u2018innate releasing mechanisms\u2019 that prompt affection and nurture in human beings: fat cheeks, large eyes set low on the face, a high forehead, a small nose and jaw, and stubby arms and legs that move in a clumsy fashion. Not just humans: puppies, baby ducks and other young animals are covered by Lorenz\u2019s theory.  Lorenz\u2019s paper did not produce an immediate reaction among the scientific community. He was a Nazi psychologist writing during wartime, exploring their loathsome eugenic theories \u2013 a reminder that the shiny face of cuteness invariably conceals a thornier side.  For decades, scientists focused on what babies perceive, what they think. But in the 21st Century, attention turned to how babies themselves are perceived, as cuteness started taking its first wobbly steps toward becoming a cohesive realm of research.  Experiments have demonstrated that viewing cute faces improves concentration and hones fine motor skills \u2013 useful modifications for handling an infant. A pair of Yale studies suggest that when people say they want to \u2018eat up\u2019 babies, it\u2019s prompted by overwhelming emotions \u2013 caused, one researcher has speculated, by frustration at not being able to care for the cute thing, channelled into aggressiveness.  These emotions are triggered chemically, deep within the brain. Experiments hooking up volunteers to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners have shown how seeing cute creatures stimulates the brain\u2019s pleasure centre, the nucleus accumbens, causing a release of dopamine, in a way similar to what happens when eating chocolate or having sex.  > Experiments have demonstrated that viewing cute faces improves concentration  Women appear to feel this reaction more strongly than men. While biologically this is explained by the need to care for infants, society\u2019s larger embrace of cuteness has led academics in gender studies to wonder whether cute culture is the sugar pill that sexism comes in \u2013 training women to be childlike \u2013\u00a0or whether it could instead be a form of empowerment in which young women take control of their own sexuality.  More recent experiments have tried to separate cuteness from its biological roots to see if there are general aesthetic standards that can make an inanimate object \u2018cute\u2019.  In a study at the University of Michigan in 2012, visual information expert Sookyung Cho asked subjects \u201cto design a cute rectangle by adjusting the size, proportion, roundness, rotation, and colour of the figure\u201d.  What she found supported the idea that \u201csmallness, roundness, tiltedness, and lightness of colour can serve as determinants of perceived cuteness in artifact design\u201d. It mattered, she found, whether the person designing the rectangle was in the US or South Korea. Cuteness is nothing if not culturally specific, and that itself has become a rich focus of inquiry.  Cuteness is so associated with Japan that the actual country \u2013 mile after mile of unadorned concrete buildings alternating with rolling green fields and periodic densely packed cities \u2013 can come as something of a surprise. The Tokyo subway is jammed with hurrying businessmen in dark suits, rushing women in paper masks, racing kids in plain school uniforms. Cute characters such as Kumamon can be hard to spot, and to expect otherwise is like going to America and expecting everyone to be a cowboy.  Still, there are pockets of cuteness to be found: tiny _yuru-kyara _charms dangling off backpacks or peeking from posters or construction barriers in the form of baby ducks.  But not everywhere, not even in most places.  > Six years ago, Kumamoto wasn\u2019t known for much \u2013 but that all changed\u2026  Even in Kumamoto during Kumamon\u2019s birthday weekend. Exit from the Shinkansen bullet train at Kumamoto station and there is nothing special on the platform. Not so much as a banner. Not until you take the escalator down and catch a glimpse of the enormous head of Kumamon set up downstairs, along with a mock stationmaster\u2019s office built for him. The train station shop is filled with Kumamon items, from bottles of sake to stuffed animals including, somewhat disturbingly, a plush set that pairs him with Hello Kitty, the wide-eyed bear directly behind the kneeling kitty in such a way as to suggest\u2026 well, you wonder if it\u2019s deliberate.  In the city, his face is spread across the sides of an office building, with birthday banners hanging from the semi-enclosed shopping arcades that are a feature of every Japanese city.  Six years ago, Kumamoto wasn\u2019t known for much. There is an active volcano, Mt Aso, nearby, and a 1960s reproduction of a dramatic 1600s-era castle that burned down in 1877. Kumamoto residents believed there was nothing in their city that anyone would want to visit. The region is largely agricultural, growing melons and strawberries.  But in 2010, Japan Railways was working to extend the Shinkansen bullet train to Kumamoto, and the city fathers were eager for tourists to use it. So they commissioned a logo to promote the area, hiring a designer who offered a stylised exclamation point (their official slogan, \u2018Kumamoto Surprise\u2019, was a bright spin on the fact that many Japanese would be surprised to find anything in Kumamoto worth seeing).  The exclamation point logo was a red blotch, resembling the sole of a shoe. The designer, seeking to embellish it, and knowing the popularity of _yuru- kyara, _added a surprised black bear. _Kuma_ is Japanese for bear. _Mon_ is local slang for \u2018man\u2019.  Paired with a mischievous personality \u2013 Mew calls him \u201cvery naughty\u201d \u2013 Kumamon made headlines after Kumamoto held a press conference to report that he was missing from his post, having run off to Osaka to urge residents there to take the train. The stunt worked. Kumamon was voted the most popular _yuru-kyara_ in 2011. (Japan has a national contest, the Yuru-kyara Grand Prix, held in November. The most recent one was attended by 1,727 different mascots and nearly 77,000 spectators. Millions of votes were cast.)  A few Kumamoto officials resisted Kumamon \u2013 their concern was he would scare off potential tourists, who\u2019d worry about encountering wild bears, of which there are none in the prefecture. But the Kumamoto governor was a fan and cannily waived licensing fees for Kumamon, encouraging manufacturers to use him royalty-free.  Rather than pay up front, in order to get approval to use the bear\u2019s image, companies are required to support Kumamoto, either by using locally manufactured parts or ingredients, or by promoting the area on their packaging. It\u2019s as if Mickey Mouse were continually hawking California oranges.  > In 2014, Kumamon gave a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan  The side of the box of the Tamiya radio-controlled \u2018Kumamon Version Buggy\u2019, for instance, has photos of the region\u2019s top tourist destinations. In one of the songs on the exercise DVD released on Kumamon\u2019s birthday, as he leads his fans through their exertions, they grunt, \u201cToh-MAY-toes\u2026 straw-BEAR-ies\u2026 wah- TER-melons\u201d \u2013 all agricultural products that are specialties of Kumamoto. Go into a grocery store and Kumamon smiles from every punnet of strawberries and honeydew wrapper.  The bullet train began service to Kumamoto on 12 March, so the date is now used as Kumamon\u2019s official birthday. He was there to greet the first scheduled train, a moment recreated during his birthday fest.  Fans line up to hug him, often reaching back for a lingering last touch as they\u2019re led off to make way for the next waiting fan. There is a tacit agreement to never allude to anything as crass as him being a man in a bear suit, to, if not accept Kumamon\u2019s reality, pretend that he exists.  In 2014, Kumamon gave a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan, where his title was given as \u2018Director of PR\u2019. The journalists posed respectful questions. \u201cHow many staff do you have, to help you out with your activities?\u201d one asked. The answer \u2013 \u201cwe have about 20 staff members in our section\u201d \u2013 was delivered by one of those subordinates, Masataka Naruo, who enjoys telling people that Kumamon is his boss.  Being cute isn\u2019t always enough, however.  For every Kumamon, for every popular _yuru-kyara,_ there are a hundred Harajuku Miccolos. A 5ft-tall yellow-and-brown bee, Harajuku Miccolo stands on the pavement, celebrating Honey Bee Day by finishing up three hours of loitering in front of the Colombin Bakery and Cafe, greeting passers-by \u2013 or trying to. Most barely glance in his direction and do not break stride, though some do come over and happily pose for the inevitable picture. There is no line.  Harajuku Miccolo is cute yet obscure, the common fate for most _yuru-kyara_. The city of Osaka has 45 different characters promoting its various aspects, who must fend off periodic calls for them to be culled in the name of efficiency; one administrator piteously argued that the government officials who create these characters work hard on them and so would feel bad if they were discontinued.  Harajuku Miccolo is trying to avoid that fate.  \u201cHe is not a success yet,\u201d admits one of his handlers, distributing cubes of the caf\u00e9\u2019s trademark honey cake. \u201cMany are not as successful\u2026\u201d  \u201c\u2026as Kumamon?\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re trying\u2026\u201d  Humanity has always embraced household gods: not the world-creating universal deity, but minor, more personal allies to soften what can be a harsh and lonely life. Not everyone has the friends they deserve or the baby they\u2019d cherish. Often people of both sexes are alone in the world.  Teddy bears exist because the night is dark and long and at some point your parents have to go to bed and leave you. There is real comfort in cuteness.  It fills an emotional need, writes Christine R Yano, a professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the author of Pink Globalization: Hello Kitty\u2019s trek across the Pacific.  > Cuteness fills an emotional need; there\u2019s a real comfort  \u201cEven in America, journalist Nicholas Kristof has written of an \u2018empathy gap\u2019 in today\u2019s society,\u201d states Yano. \u201cHe points to the place of objects that may be considered promoters of \u2018happiness\u2019, \u2018solace\u2019, \u2018comfort\u2019. When a society needs to heal, it seeks comfort in the familiar. And often the familiar may reside in \u2018cute\u2019. Witness the use of teddy bears as sources of comfort for firefighters in the wake of NYC\u2019s 9-11.\u201d  Kumamon is a power station of empathy generation. In the weeks after the Kumamoto earthquake, Kumamon was so necessary that in his absence his fans simply conjured him up themselves, independently, as an object of sympathy, a tireless saviour, an obvious hero.  Three weeks after the 14 April earthquake, Kumamon visited the convention hall of the hard-hit town of Mashiki, where residents were still sleeping in their cars for protection as 1,200 tremors continued to rumble across the area. The visit was reported on TV and in the papers as news, as if a long-sought survivor had stumbled out of the wreckage alive.  The children, many of whom had lost their homes in the earthquake, flocked around him, squealing, hugging, taking pictures. Their friend had returned.  _Join 600,000+ Future fans by liking us on_ _**Facebook**__, or follow us on__**Twitter**__,__**Google+**__,__**LinkedIn**__and__**Instagram**__._  _If you liked this story, __sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter__, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

For instance, when we are feeling stressed we might calm our nerves by focusing attention on our breathing. If we have a throbbing toothache, we might try to ease the pain through a meditative technique. And when we are feeling down, we may cheer ourselves up by imagining ourselves in our \u2018happy place\u2019. Those who\u2019ve tried similar strategies know they often work, but with varying degrees of success.  Now imagine if you could see what was happening inside your brain as you experienced emotions and sensations such as pain, anxiety, depression, fear, and pleasure \u2013 all in real-time. Suddenly, why you feel the way you feel might not be such a mystery, and the effectiveness of the little mental techniques you use to deal with daily life would be clearly visible.  > Through practice, you can learn to strengthen control over the mind similar to how a weightlifter targets a specific muscle group  That\u2019s the idea behind a new technique known as \u201creal-time fMRI\u201d. By receiving specific visual feedback about brain activity while executing mental tricks and strategies, we can learn to consciously control our emotions, sensations and cravings as if they were being manipulated by a volume knob on a stereo. Through practice, you can learn to strengthen control over the mind similar to how a weightlifter targets a specific muscle group \u2013 and it raises the tantalising possibility of a future where we can train advanced mental abilities far beyond our own today.  The first demonstration that real-time fMRI could be a powerful tool came in 2005, with a study where researchers taught people how to control pain_._ Eight people lay in the scanner while subjected to a painful hot sensation on their skin. The researchers showed them a virtual flame to represent activation in the rostral ACC, a brain region involved in pain processing. Through various cognitive strategies, such as \u201cattend toward or away from the painful stimulus\u201d and \u201cattempt to perceive the stimulus as high or low intensity\u201d, participants quickly learned to control the size of the flame, thereby directly altering the level of electrical activation in the pain- responsive region.  Importantly, decreases or increases in this neural signal correlated with subjective feelings of pain, as measured by a questionnaire and a 10-point pain scale. Amazingly, in just a single 13-minute session participants learned to easily control the size of the flame and were able to reduce their pain by over 50%.  Since then, research using real-time fMRI has exploded, and new clinical and experimental uses seem to pop just about every month. The ways of displaying brain activity to people also now includes feedback such as audio sounds or a \u2018thermometer display\u2019 via virtual reality goggles.  > The training can create changes in the brain that have long-lasting effects  A\u00a02017 study\u00a0published in the journal\u00a0Appetite\u00a0showed that the training could fight obesity. Over the course of a four-day training period, overweight males learned to increase the interaction between the brain areas involved in executive functioning and reward processing, which improved self-control and led to healthier food choices.  Another\u00a0study\u00a0published this year found that by learning control over the right inferior prefrontal cortex, a brain region that is impaired in those with ADHD, adolescents could decrease ADHD symptoms and improve sustained attention. These benefits remained when the participants were tested 11 months later, demonstrating that the training can create changes in the brain that have long-lasting effects.  And a\u00a02016 study\u00a0found that elderly adults using the technique improved their cognition. It\u2019s possible that younger individuals could boost brain function this way too. In fact, a\u00a02015 study\u00a0with healthy adults showed that neurofeedback training could improve focus and reduce lapses of attention.  Other recent studies have found that the training can be used to treat\u00a0PTSD in war veterans,\u00a0depression,\u00a0anxiety, and even\u00a0cigarette addiction. Another study by James Sulzer at the University of Texas, Austin and colleagues showed that participants could learn to\u00a0regulate levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, an application that could be used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease.  The research clearly shows that the technology can be used in countless ways, but how effective it can be in the long term, and whether it is even practical, is yet to be seen. Since real-time fMRI requires expensive equipment, its immediate use should be for treating severe conditions that lack more affordable therapies. However, as with any new technology, over time fMRI scanners will become cheaper, smaller, and more accessible.  > If a few 10-minute sessions can produce statistically significant results, what could 10,000 hours of practice do?  And this opens up a whole new world of possibilities. To get a sense of the untapped potential, imagine what it would be like for an athlete or body builder to always be working out without ever getting a chance to see their body or the size of the weights. It would be impossibly hard to determine which exercises are working and which aren\u2019t, and exactly to what degree. Effectively honing just about any skill requires visual feedback, and the same could be said for brain training.  What would be the ultimate potential of real-time fMRI training if one had easy access and could practise control over the brain weekly, or even daily, for many years? If a few 10-minute sessions can produce statistically significant results, what could 10,000 hours of practice do? There\u2019s no true way to know, but something akin to \u201cmental superpowers\u201d may not be out of the question.  Neurofeedback training could provide a shortcut to the types of abilities displayed by monks, for example, who can completely block out excruciating pain and change their physiology to\u00a0dry a soaking towel placed on their back in a chilly room.  So, while the ultimate potential of the technology remains to be seen, it is not unreasonable to believe that the awesome mind-over-matter abilities of expert meditators that take years to develop could one day be learned by everyone in a fraction of the time.  _Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on\u00a0_**_Facebook_**_, or follow us on _**_Twitter_**_._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0_**_sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter_**_, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Officials from the technology giant have denied the company has any intention of making cars.  \"The test run approval does not mean that Samsung is making a self-driving car\", a spokesperson was reported as saying.  \"The pilot run is being carried out for software and solution development for an autonomous car, nothing more.\"  ## 'Complex manoeuvres'  The car will be fitted with laser and radar sensors made by other companies, paired with Samsung's artificial intelligence and deep learning software.  The aim is to teach the AI how to drive better in a variety of conditions, including poor weather.  \"Driving is a complex task. Some things can be automated very easily, but a number are difficult to automate, like small manoeuvres,\" Dr. Siraj Ahmed Shaikh from the Centre for Mobility and Transport (CMT) at Coventry University, told the BBC.  By focusing on \"the very fancy cutting edge deep mind technology,\" Dr Shaikh said, \"it's the very difficult decisions in terms of complex manoeuvres that [Samsung] are trying to overcome.\"  Samsung also plans to develop its own computer modules and sensors, according to South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.  In November last year, the company bought US firm Harman, which develops such software and components, for $8bn (\u00a36.2bn).  In January this year, it announced plans to develop a self-driving platform that could be sold to car manufacturers.  \"The automotive industry is set up in a similar way to the computer industry, where you can buy a motherboard from one place, and other components from somewhere else and bang them together\", Dr Shaikh said.  \"The manufacturers have a very good view of the supply chain, what technology is out there, and how to put it together.\"", "newsHeadline": "Samsung self-driving car trial in South Korea approved - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39779208?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story", "countriesMentioned": ["Norway", "South Korea"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p052mvpd.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionMOL Triumph arrives in Southampton as the biggest ship to ever dock in the UK  The biggest ship to dock in the UK has arrived in Southampton.

What changes a corporate branding disaster from being a costly and damaging affair, to one with fatal consequences for the company concerned?  How is it some firms have been able to bounce back while others are unable to survive?  Both the German car giant Volkswagen and South Korean mobile phone maker Samsung have been mired in controversy in recent times.  VW is still dealing with its diesel emissions scandal, and Samsung has had to face overheating phone batteries.  Yet both have put these corporate disasters behind them.  VW has just seen its pretax profits rise 44.3%, while Samsung's operating profits have gone up by 48%. Other firms have not been so fortunate.  ## Emissions scandal  In 2015, it emerged that Volkswagen had fitted illegal software to its diesel vehicles allowing them to cheat on emissions tests. It meant VW's diesel vehicles were able to emit up to 40 times the legally allowable pollution level.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption VW's emissions scandal has so far cost it $25bn  The revelations came as a shock to many, and played havoc with VW's reputation as a seller of solid, dependable German cars.  The scandal sparked a global backlash against the firm, and multiple lawsuits.  VW has so far agreed to pay about $25bn (\u00a319bn) to address US claims from owners, regulators, states and dealers - and it is under increasing pressure to pay up in other countries, too.  Yet this public relations disaster has not stopped VW from overtaking Toyota as the world's largest carmaker, and nor has it permanently hit its profit- making abilities.  As the scandal broke, VW put together a comprehensive plan to deal with it. It has acknowledged its wrong-doing - pleading guilty in the US as part of an agreement with regulators.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In the wake of the crisis VW has undertaken significant cost-cutting  At the same time, the group has embarked on a significant cost-cutting exercise - dropping unprofitable models - and is focussing on emerging markets and investing heavily in electric vehicles.  \"One could argue that this crisis was a catalyst for VW,\" says Shwetha Surender, principal consultant at analysts Frost &amp; Sullivan.  \"The company has restructured itself in a way which it might not have done, had the emissions scandal never happened.\"  The scandal has cost VW billions, but could have cost it even more if it had mishandled things, she says.  \"They might have been forced to sell-off their commercial vehicles division as well as a couple of their premium brands.\"  What VW did was clearly wrong but in the way it has dealt with the scandal \"it has had a positive effect on the group\", says Ms Surender.  ## Burning batteries  If you're one of the world's leading smartphone sellers, the last thing you want is to have to recall one of your flagship products.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption A Samsung Note 7 handset caught fire during a lab test in Singapore  Yet that is just what South Korea's electronics giant Samsung was forced to do amid reports of fire-prone batteries.  Last September, Samsung recalled 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after complaints of overheating and exploding batteries.  The firm replaced the phones. However, that was followed by reports that those phones were also overheating.  The debacle cost Samsung about $5.3bn, and has been hugely damaging to its reputation.  Samsung has said it takes \"responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of the battery design and manufacturing process\".  That acceptance is a crucial part of its crisis management strategy, says Wayne Lam, analyst at IHS Markit.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Samsung has accepted its responsibility for the battery flaws  \"What Samsung has done in handling the crisis is pretty textbook stuff. They have been upfront with consumers and investors - they have gone through their 'mea culpa' moments.  \"From a financial perspective they have mostly put this behind them, though they still have to win back consumer trust.\"  Vital to winning back that trust is making sure there are no more mistakes. With its new Galaxy 8 phone, Wayne Lam says the firm has taken a conservative approach.  \"They have tweaked the charging parameters and have been very cautious when it comes to the battery design, unlike the Note 7's battery which clearly didn't work.\"  ## Unreliable tests  For VW and Samsung the damage has been bad but survivable, but for controversial US blood-testing company Theranos its future is much more uncertain.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes once ranked as America's richest self-made woman  It pioneered tests that it said could detect cancer and cholesterol with just a few drops of blood obtained via a finger-prick.  Launched in 2003 it was said to be worth $9bn in 2014, but in 2015 a report by The Wall Street Journal claimed its device produced inaccuracies.  This led to an investigation by the US government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which later revoked the company's licence to operate in California and banned its founder Elizabeth Holmes from running a lab for at least two years.  The firm has since slashed its workforce by 40%, but analysts say it is unclear if it will ever be able to recover its reputation.  At least Theranos is still in existence, not so the US media and celebrity news website Gawker.  It filed for bankruptcy protection last year to avoid paying damages having lost a $140m lawsuit brought by former wrestler Hulk Hogan, after it published a video of him having sex with the wife of a friend.  Gawker had defended its right to publish the video as part of its celebrity news coverage. The court rejected the claim and the financial cost of losing forced Gawker to close down.  ## Doing 'a Ratner'  Yet nothing comes close to a firm being sabotaged by its own boss.  Gerald Ratner famously wiped \u00a3500m from the value of his own jewellery group, Ratners, with one speech in 1991.  Image caption Gerald Ratner, the boss whose speech ruined his own company  Referring to his firm's cut-glass sherry decanters, he said \"People say, 'how can you sell this for such a low price?' I say because it's total crap.\"  For good measure he added that his stores' earrings were \"cheaper than a Marks and Spencer prawn sandwich but probably wouldn't last as long\".  These ill-judged comments accelerated the decline of Britain's biggest jewellery group.  It plunged into the red, closed 330 shops as customers stayed away in droves and changed its name to Signet Group two years later.  Mr Ratner has since bounced back and runs a successful online jewellery business, but his speech is still famous in the corporate world as an example of the value of branding and image over quality.  Such gaffes are now known as \"doing a Ratner\".  _Follow Tim Bowler on Twitter_@timbowlerbbc", "newsHeadline": "What does it take to destroy a company's brand name? - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39810979?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "Singapore", "United States", "Japan", "South Korea", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Contact lens](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10961/production/_96173976_mediaitem96173975.jpg) Image copyright ccc  Samsung's eye-scanning security technology, used on the new Galaxy S8 smartphone, has been fooled with a photograph and a contact lens.

Your fingers are already holding your phone, so why not use prints rather than wave your phone in front of your face?  \"If you want to be really secure, choose fingerprints and a secret number.

That's what some TSB customers will be able to do from September when the bank introduces iris recognition to its mobile banking app.  It will be the first bank in Europe to introduce the technology, but its arrival will test customers' trust in biometric technology.  Customers will need the latest Samsung Galaxy S8 to use the new way of accessing their TSB accounts.  ## 'Fast and natural'  Once they have registered their irises, they will be able to log in by simply looking at the phone.  TSB's chief information officer Carlos Abarca said iris recognition was the most secure form of biometric authentication currently available. \"It takes advantage of 266 different characteristics, compared with 40 for fingerprints.\"  He said it offered customers a combination of security and convenience: \"It's extremely fast - it takes less than a second to get in - and the gesture is very natural. And you don't have to remember secret numbers or passwords.\"  Samsung added iris scanning to the biometric security options, alongside face recognition and fingerprint scanning, when the phone went on sale earlier this year.  ## Fooling the scanner  In May the German hacking group the Chaos Computer Club said it had fooled Samsung's iris scanner with a photo used to make a dummy eye.  Samsung insisted that it would take an extraordinary set of circumstances, where someone had access to both the phone and a high definition photo of its owner's eye, to beat its system.  TSB's Carlos Abarca said he was confident in the security of iris scanning: \"There's no security option that is absolutely perfect. We're relying not only on the biometrics but the digital certificate on the phone. To fake your eyeball is potentially possible - but it is extremely difficult.\"  Biometrics has been touted as the solution to establishing someone's identity for the last twenty years but has made slow progress.  You can see facial recognition and iris scanning in use at automated passport control systems in various parts of the world, but it's the widespread adoption of smartphones which promises to supercharge adoption of the technology.  The fingerprint scanning which arrived on Apple's iPhone in 2013 and is now a feature of many Android smartphones allows millions of users to pay for anything from a cup of coffee to a train journey by touching their phone.  ## Privacy concerns  Isabelle Moeller of the Biometrics Institute has been working to promote adoption of the technology since 2001.  She says consumers have two major concerns: \"Privacy and safety - they want to know their data is secure and the system can't be spoofed.\"  But she says the industry is establishing benchmarks for best practice: \"If we can get that right the convenience that biometrics offers can create a fantastic customer experience.\"  TSB customers can already log on to their mobile banking app using fingerprint recognition. The minority with a high-end Samsung may try out iris scanning when it becomes an option in September.  But in the biometric battle the simplicity of just putting a finger on your phone may prove more attractive than holding it up and looking at it.", "newsHeadline": "TSB to roll out iris scanning tech - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40663365?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-correspondent", "countriesMentioned": ["South Korea"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Special Counsel Robert Mueller thinks.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/EFF4/production/_96882416_gettyimages-175801045.jpg) Image copyright Getty Images  Now that Hurricane Junior has blown through Washington, special counsel Robert Mueller - charged with investigating possible ties between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign - faces the task of sifting through the debris.  According to CNN, the former FBI director and his team of crack investigators were caught somewhat flat-footed by the recent email revelations. They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.  As it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.  The president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably \"transparent\" in discussing.  Key members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.  But while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?  Here are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.  * * *  ## What else did Rob Goldstone think the Russian government was doing to help Mr Trump?  Nestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the \"official documents and information\" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just \"part of\" Russia's support for his father, \"helped along by Aras and Emin\" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.  It's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his \"love it\" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.  That kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: \"What's the rest of the story?\"  Why is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?  * * *  ## What did Veselnitskaya do next?  Even if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.  On Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been \"longing for\" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.  \"They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\" she said.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Natalia Veselnitskaya went back to Russia with some key information about the Trump campaign  In other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.  Given that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.  In the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.  Derogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.  The Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p058jhfw.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionTrump voters in Nebraska dismiss Russia story  * * *  ## Did Goldstone ever reach out to Rhona?  Another choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might \"send this info to your father via Rhona\" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.  Graff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.  \"If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,\" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.  The White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya - despite the fact that his son, son-in-law and campaign chief were in attendance and it took place in his New York tower.  If this assertion is proven to be inaccurate, Rhona could be the key.  Trump Jr meeting scandal: The key players  * * *  ## What did Emin Agalarov and Trump Jr talk about on 6 June?  The middle portion of the email chain released on Tuesday morning involved Trump Jr and Goldstone trying to set up a phone conversation with Russian pop star/businessman Emin Agalarov.  After a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the \"Russian government attorney\" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week.  Mr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face- to-face gathering.  And what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign?  Did Donald Trump Jr break the law?  * * *  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald Trump told a New York crowd in June 2016 he was about to give a \"very interesting\" speech about Hillary Clinton  ## What was the story behind Mr Trump's cancelled anti-Clinton speech?  Four days after the first email from Goldstone to Trump Jr about the incriminating information the Russia government was said to have about Mrs Clinton, candidate Trump promised to give a \"major speech\" the following week discussing \"all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons\", including Mrs Clinton's alleged misdeeds while serving as secretary of state.  \"I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,\" he added.  That speech, originally announced for the Monday after the Trump camp's New York meeting with Veselnitskaya, never took place.  Was this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton?

Donald Trump Jr met Natalia Veselnitskaya believing she had information that would damage his father's opponent Hillary Clinton.  Mr Trump Jr told Fox News the meeting was \"such a nothing\", and \"a wasted 20 minutes\", but accepted he should have handled it differently.  Critics say he may have broken federal laws.  Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said he he is asking Mr Trump Jr to testify and will subpoena him if necessary.  US intelligence believe Moscow tried to sway the 2016 election in Mr Trump's favour and there are ongoing investigations into potential links between Mr Trump's campaign team and Russia.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Donald Trump and wife Melania will be guests of honour at France's Bastille Day festivities  Despite early tensions over climate change and trade, President Macron has made more of an effort recently to woo Mr Trump in a bid to boost France's influence on the world stage, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris.  Before he left Washington on Wednesday, President Trump sought to dispel media reports saying his administration was in crisis over alleged collusion between his campaign team and Russia, telling Reuters it was \"a hoax made up by the Democrats\".  He has previously suggested other agents may have meddled in the election, despite senior officials in his own administration blaming Russia.  Mr Trump said he had not been aware of his son's meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya until a couple of days ago.  Defending Donald Jr's decision to attend, he added: \"Many people, and many political pros, said everybody would do that.\"  The president described the election campaign as \"a wild time\" when \"we would meet with many people\".  He refused to say that he regretted Donald Jr's actions, commenting: \"Most of the phony politicians who are Democrats who I watched over the last couple of days... would have taken that meeting in a heartbeat.\"  In another interview, with the Christian Broadcasting Network, he also said he gets along \"very well\" with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p058jhfw.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media caption\"Less tweeting, more doing\" - views from Trump heartland in Nebraska  His comments came days after his much-anticipated meeting with Mr Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.  \"People said, oh, they shouldn't get along. Well, who are the people saying that? I think we get along very, very well,\" he said.  Mr Trump cited the recent ceasefire in south-western Syria as an example of how co-operation with Mr Putin worked.  He said he was sure the Russians would have preferred to have Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House.  Why? \"If Hillary had won, our military would be decimated,\" he said.  \"Our energy would be much more expensive. That's what Putin doesn't like about me. And that's why I say, why would he want me?\"  He told Reuters he had asked Mr Putin flat-out if his government meddled in the US election.  \"I said, 'Did you do it?' He said, 'No, I did not, absolutely not.' I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, 'Absolutely not.'\"  \"Somebody did say, if he did do it, you wouldn't have found out about it.

He has been named as special counsel to oversee the inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the November 2016 presidential election, including possible co-ordination between Russia and members of the Trump campaign.  He has also been instructed to look into any obstruction of the probe itself.  Robert Mueller III - to use the full name that has earned him the moniker \"Bobby Three Sticks\" - served as FBI director for 12 years under Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama, making him the longest-serving bureau chief since J Edgar Hoover (director from 1935 to 1972).  ## Read more  He took over the bureau in 2001, just a week before the 9/11 attacks, and found himself tasked with restoring the agency's reputation after it and the CIA were found to have failed to share information on the threat.  Described as \"no-nonsense\" and \"straitlaced\", Mr Mueller has stood his ground in a showdown with a previous US president.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Mueller was appointed FBI chief by George W Bush just a week before the 9/11 attacks  In 2004, George W Bush tried to reinstate a post 9/11 programme that allowed wiretapping without a court warrant, which the justice department had determined was not legal.  Mr Mueller, the then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey (Mr Mueller's successor at the FBI until he was sacked by President Trump in May 2017), and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft are widely reported to have threatened to resign en masse, backing down only when Mr Bush made changes to the programme.  Mr Mueller and Mr Comey - who was leading the FBI inquiry into alleged Russia interference in last year's election until his sacking - were close allies at the time, according to author Garrett Graf, who has written a biography of Mr Mueller.  ## 'No axe to grind'  The 72-year-old Princeton graduate was no stranger to high-stakes cases even before he took the helm of the FBI.  During a stint heading the justice department's criminal division from 1990 to 1993, he oversaw the investigation into the 1988 Pan Am airline bombing over Lockerbie in Scotland and the drug case against former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Mueller (right), kept on by former President Barack Obama, enjoys strong bipartisan support  He is also known for leading the probe into the 1991 collapse of the Luxembourg-registered Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).  Mr Mueller joined the Marines in 1968, leading a platoon in the Vietnam War, before completing a law degree at the University of Virginia in 1973.  He began his law career at a private firm in San Francisco in 1973, before entering public service in 1976 as an assistant US attorney in San Francisco.  Although he has mainly been appointed into posts by Republican administrations, he enjoys strong bipartisan support, and was kept on as FBI director for an extra two years by President Barack Obama.  Long-time colleague David Kris has described him as \"experienced, knowledgeable, capable\" and \"utterly incorruptible\".  \"He cannot be intimidated. At this stage in his career, he has nothing to prove, no reputation to burnish, no axe to grind. He is ramrod straight in his integrity,\" he wrote on the Brookings Institute's Lawfare blog.  ## White shirts  More recently Mr Mueller has worked for the private firm WilmerHale, which is reported to have counted Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort among its clients.  The firm said Mr Mueller would step down immediately and told Politico that Mr Mueller had not been involved with any of those representations.  While at the firm, he has played a lead role in the settlement of US litigation stemming from the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal.

The encounter is thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and a member of Donald Trump's inner circle.  A special prosecutor is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with alleged Russian efforts to influence last November's US election.  Both Mr Trump Jr and the lawyer say the campaign was not discussed.  Mr Trump Jr was accompanied by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign head Paul J Manafort, meeting Natalia Veselnitskaya at New York's Trump Tower on 9 June, two weeks after Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination.  Mr Trump Jr said in a statement that they discussed a suspended programme for Americans to adopt Russian children.  He said it \"was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow-up\".  Mr Kushner's lawyer said he had previously disclosed the meeting on security clearance forms.  President Vladimir Putin suspended the adoption programme in 2012 after the US Congress voted in a law to allow the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations.  Ms Veselnitskaya, who played a key role campaigning against the law, said \"nothing at all was discussed about the presidential campaign.  \"I have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government.\"  Last week Mr Trump said interference in the election \"could well have been\" carried out by countries other than Russia and interference \"has been happening for a long time\".", "newsHeadline": "Donald Trump Jr met Russian lawyer before election - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40549398", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "The Comet, which was first unveiled to the public in 1949, heralded a new age in flying.

But largely because of that fragility, the tiny island \u2013 15 miles (24km) west of the mainland \u2013 has learned how to be self-sufficient. Remarkably, even in terms of energy.  > The maintenance team includes the island\u2019s baker, gardener and knitter  In 2008, Eigg became the world\u2019s first community to launch an off-grid electric system powered by wind, water and solar \u2013 and this group of residents largely taught themselves how to do it. Before that, without access to a national grid, residents relied on noisy, expensive diesel generators that only ran for a few hours a day. The electrification scheme made 24-hour power available to residents for the first time.  Today, this 12 sq mile (30 sq km) island continues to set an example, not only in how to deliver electricity from renewable energy, but how societies could meet their energy needs without access to a national grid \u2013 a challenge affecting nearly one-fifth of the world\u2019s population.  **Power play**  When I arrive, the island\u2019s tearoom by the pier is busy with visiting researchers. Two groups, one from Brazil, the other from Glasgow, have come to learn about Eigg\u2019s system. Previous groups have come from as far as Alaska and Malawi to assess whether this may be a model for bringing electricity to the nearly 1.3 billion people who lack regular access.  Eigg is powered by three renewable sources \u2013 hydro, wind and solar \u2013 integrated into a stable, high-voltage underground grid. The system\u2019s designer John Booth, who is the former director of its operator Eigg Electric, took me out to see how the system works. On a cliff below the 1,289ft (390m) peak of An Sg\u00f9rr, four wind turbines feed up to 24 kW of energy into the grid. Although the turbines\u2019 blades are whirring, when I visit they are offering only about half of that: an indication of the importance of the system\u2019s integration of three renewables.  Further north \u2013 uphill from Glebe Barn, the island\u2019s youth hostel \u2013 photovoltaic panels face south, angled at 30 degrees to catch any sunlight that might break through the clouds. \u201cOn average, over the year, they provide about 9.5% of their rated output,\u201d Booth says. (The solar panels have a 50kW capacity). \u201cSo if you use these as the source of your electricity over the year, you\u2019d be dead disappointed.\u201d  Erecting solar panels in Scotland may seem like folly. But in the summer \u2013 thanks to the long hours of daylight that benefit Eigg\u2019s far-north location \u2013 the panels do the heavy lifting. \u201cThese really come into their own in the months of May, June and July, when we get the really bright long days. They will give you over 25% of their rated output,\u201d Booth says. (When you take into account periods of darkness, that is almost the maximum possible to get in those months). \u201cAnd that is when we tend not to have much wind and not much rain. The set-up that we\u2019ve got now will carry the island all day and put charge into the batteries for the evening.\u201d  > On average, Eigg runs on 90 to 95% renewable energy  Three hydroelectric generators harness energy from running water, of which there is plenty in winter. The biggest generator, on the north side of the island behind Laig Bay, generates up to 100 kW \u2013 powered by water traveling a half-mile (1km) and then down a 330ft (100m) drop. Two smaller hydros on the south side produce 5 to 6 kW each.  On average, Eigg runs on 90-95% renewable energy. There are still times, usually in spring, when the weather doesn\u2019t cooperate and the use of generators is necessary. Two 70 kW backup generators add power and charge the battery bank.  Then there are days, usually in winter, when the island has the opposite problem: it creates more energy than it can use or store. Just as Eigg Electric has to manage its deficiencies itself, it has to manage its surpluses. Fortunately, it has a system for that too: when there is a surplus of power, electric heaters in the community hall, pier lobby and two churches automatically turn on. This keeps these shared spaces warm all through the winter and requires \u201cvirtually no central heating in the system at all,\u201d says Booth. \u201cWe don\u2019t charge for it because the whole community benefits.\u201d  It seems fitting that the electric grid\u2019s surpluses benefit the community, since the inhabitants were responsible for the electric grid\u2019s development. In June, the island will celebrate 20 years of community ownership. Previously, Eigg had a succession of\u00a0landlords; most tenants had no legal tenure, making development virtually impossible. In 1997, the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust, a partnership between the residents, Scottish Wildlife Trust and Highland Council, purchased the island. A few years later, residents began working on the electrification project. Eigg Electric \u2013 a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust \u2013 was incorporated in 2005. \u201cThe whole thing,\u201d says Booth, \u201cis run by and for the island.\u201d  This model of public ownership, as much as the grid itself, has set an example for communities abroad. Last year, Community Energy Malawi visited Eigg. Georgy Davis of the sister organisation Community Energy Scotland says that the group \u201clearned a great deal about what could be achieved by an active and engaged community who have a belief in themselves\u201d.  > There was not one person on the island who could be described as an electrical engineer \u2013 John Booth  The Malawi members also were \u201cparticularly encouraged that people from a non- technical background were able to learn,\u201d Davis says. Eigg Electric\u2019s six- person, part-time maintenance team is made up of such unlikely candidates as the island\u2019s baker, gardener and knitter.  Everyone learned how the system works by following the construction company as they built it. \u201cThere was not one person on the island who could be described as an electrical engineer,\u201d says Booth, a biochemist by training. \u201cI just did my homework. Sometimes if a decision had to be made, I\u2019d stay up all night working on it.\u201d  **Price of power**  The \u00a31.66m project largely was financed by the European Union\u2019s European Regional Development Fund, as well as by national bodies and contributions from the islanders. Where possible, Eigg Electric cut down on costs by doing certain jobs themselves, such as laying concrete for the solar panels. Still, the initial investment may prove an obstacle for other communities hoping to copy Eigg\u2019s model. As a recent analysis of the island\u2019s electric grid points out, most of the nearly 1.3 billion people currently living off-grid are in the developing world.  \u201cThat is the major challenge for any country,\u201d says the study\u2019s co-author, Subhes Bhattacharyya of De Montfort University, \u201cespecially in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, where most people lack access. They need initial support for capital funding.\u201d  Eigg\u2019s community agreed on every aspect of the system, including on pricing \u2013 currently set at 23p per kWh plus a 12p daily standing charge, slightly higher than the mainland \u2013 and usage caps. To not overload the system and ensure everyone has fair access to power, residents voted unanimously to approve the requirement that each house gets a maximum of 5 kW to use at one time \u2013 the equivalent of running an electric kettle and washing machine simultaneously. Businesses get 10 kW. To keep track, meters tell them how much they are using at any one time; exceed the cap, and your electricity goes out. To deter this from happening, the user is required to call the Eigg Electric team to turn it back on at a \u00a320 penalty fee. It happens rarely, says Booth.  To communicate when renewables are generating a relatively low amount of energy, meanwhile, a traffic light system is set up at the pier. A red light requests residents to limit their usage; a green light, normal usage.  It seems easy enough to manage and residents appear satisfied. At Booth\u2019s house, Christine, John\u2019s wife, serves me tea and toast separately to avoid using the toaster and kettle simultaneously. With a low wattage kettle, doing so still would be comfortably below the 5 kW cap \u2013 but she is conscious of spreading out her energy usage to benefit the system whenever possible. \u201cYou get used to doing it that way,\u201d she says.  Over the last 20 years, in contrast to many of its island neighbours, Eigg\u2019s population has risen \u2013 from 65 residents to around 100. New houses have been built and new businesses have launched. \u201cThe demand on the system is rising,\u201d says Booth. \u201cBut all the evidence says that we got it right at the outset and it\u2019s coping.\u201d  Bhattacharyya says Eigg exemplifies how not only basic energy requirements, but even the demands of a developed country, can be met with an off-grid system. Examples like Eigg can show the world \u201cthat full off-grid systems work\u201d \u2013 and that a fully renewable system has the capacity to \u201csupport modern- day living and improve quality of life.\u201d  _This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

But standing patiently in line appears to be one of Britain\u2019s greatest prides alongside our love of tea, fish and chips, and drinking in pubs. A recent survey of 2,000 Brits found queue-jumping to be our biggest pet hate \u2013 and we like to assume that we are a bit better at waiting patiently than the average foreigner.  This obsession dates back to at least the middle of the last century, when George Orwell tried to get inside the mind of a tourist visiting the UK for the first time. \u201cOur imaginary foreign observer would certainly be struck by our gentleness: by the orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues,\u201d he wrote in his essay The English People.  The website of the etiquette guide Debrett\u2019s takes a similar view today, writing: \u201cFor foreigners, the art of queuing must seem esoteric at best and maddening at worst: queue-barging is the worst solecism a foreigner can commit; even the reticent English will feel justified in sharply pointing out the back of the line to any errant queue-jumpers.\u201d  > One columnist even goes as far as to label Britain\u2019s asylum seekers as \u201cqueue-jumping knifemen\u201d \u2013 as if line cutting were somehow on a par with terrorism  Sadly, these colourful claims are often tinged with darker undertones. In another essay from the mid-1940s, Orwell documents how a failure to wait in line was the foundation of several anti-Semitic slurs. Newspaper reports today show that it continues to be a source of resentment against ethnic minorities and immigrants. Peter Hitchens, a columnist for the Mail on Sunday, goes as far as to decry the \u201cqueue-jumping knifemen\u201d seeking asylum on Britain\u2019s shores \u2013 as if the odd case of line-cutting were somehow on a par with terrorism. The art of queuing has been considered so central to our identity that it was even incorporated into the government\u2019s citizenship exam.  The irony, of course, is that the word queue is itself an immigrant, flown in from across the Channel.  So what\u2019s the truth behind the myth? Was George Mikes, the Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9, right when he claimed that \u201can Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly queue of one\u201d? Or is it a more universal occupation shared by many different cultures across the world? Taking this closer look at the queue doesn\u2019t just answer idle curiosity: it can also address deeper questions about the nature of human altruism.  Let\u2019s start across the Atlantic with an experiment by the famed US psychologist Stanley Milgram. Milgram is best-known for his studies of obedience and control in the 1960s, in which participants were asked to deliver increasingly powerful electric shocks to a fellow subject (who was really an actor, pretending to be hurt). They were told that is was a necessary part of the experiment, and not to take notice of the apparent cries of pain. Milgram found that the participants were surprisingly willing to follow the scientists\u2019 orders, with the majority agreeing to administer even the most powerful electric shock of 450 volts. The experiment was meant to illustrate how easily we will allow our morals to be dictated by a greater authority.  By the 1980s, however, Milgram\u2019s interests had softened, as he turned to explore the taboo of queue-jumping. He sent his research team to New York\u2019s train stations and betting shops, where they sidled up to the waiting customers and inserted themselves between the third and fourth person \u2013 then stayed for around a minute before departing.  The New Yorkers were far from happy to see someone pushing in front of them. In around 15% of cases, they managed to contain their feelings with dirty looks and hostile stares; 20% of the time, they were more vocal, calling out \u201cNo way! The line\u2019s back there\u201d or \u201cHey buddy, we\u2019ve been waiting. Get off the line and go to the back.\u201d In around 10% of the experiments, their outrage became physical, tugging at the intruders\u2019 sleeves or forcibly shoving them out of the line.  But of even more interest were the feelings of the intruders themselves. Milgram noted that it often took half an hour for his US colleagues to work up the courage to enter the line, and their anxiety was often so great that they were visibly pale and suffered from nausea. (It is an interesting parallel with Milgram\u2019s previous experiments \u2013 apparently, queue-jumping causes nearly as much soul-searching as electrocuting someone.) Although Milgram\u2019s work does not offer a direct comparison, their discomfort would seem to suggest that New Yorkers are just as concerned about disrupting these social norms as any British person.  There are many other examples, says Dave Fagundes, a law professor at the University of Houston, who recently explored the subject in an article for Law and Social Inquiry. He points to the elaborate queuing system that has grown around Duke University\u2019s highly popular basketball games, for which students will happily camp for days in a \u2018tent city\u2019 in order to gain tickets. \u201cMany people think of it as a rite of passage for being a Duke student,\u201d says Fagundes.  The etiquette of the Duke queues are so complex that it has even been formalised into a 36-page rule book, setting forth regulations like how many people should be present in a tent at any one time or which toilets you can use while waiting in line. Fagundes jokes that the \u201cbyzantine\u201d system \u201ccould form the basis for an advanced law school seminar\u201d.  Beyond the US, anecdotal evidence would suggest that northern European countries like Germany and Sweden are equally conscious of queuing etiquette. But this isn\u2019t confined to the stereotypically rule-abiding northern nations. Consider the Nigerian oil shortage of the 1970s: customers formed extremely well organised lines at petrol stations despite the scarcity of the precious resource. \u201cIt shows that very orderly queues are not solely the province of Anglo-American society,\u201d says Fagundes.  > Very orderly queues are not solely the province of Anglo-American society \u2013 Dave Fagundes  Needless to say, however, there will be some variation between cultures. Fagundes describes the \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9n es \u00faltimo?\u201d system that prevails in Spain and other Latin countries, for instance, where people entering a caf\u00e9 will simply ask the \u201cwho\u2019s last?\u201d to establish when to take their turn; the disadvantage, of course, is that you have no idea exactly how long you are going to have to wait. And admittedly, people from places such as mainland China may once have been more likely to form a more muddled huddle in certain situations, leading the government to advise citizens on more orderly queuing before the Beijing Olympics. But taking a global view, Britain appears not to be especially preoccupied with queuing.  This is more profound than mere parlour-room chit-chat: Fagundes thinks that queuing neatly illustrates the evolutionary theory of \u201cstrong reciprocity\u201d. According to this idea, most humans are inherently altruistic, with a powerful instinct to cooperate with the group \u2013 provided that everyone is contributing fairly. Crucially, according to this theory, we will punish others for free- riding even if it comes at a cost to us personally; our sense of fair play overrules our immediate self-interest. (The benefit is that it results in a more stable society in the long term.)\u00a0This is opposed to other theories of altruism, which state that we cooperate only to boost our own resources. In those scenarios, we would forego punishing others if means that we lose out overall.  Strong reciprocity has been shown to determine the results of various economic games in which a participant is given small pots of money to share with their partner. The partner can either accept or reject the offers made for them. The catch is that if they reject the offer, both participants will go away with nothing. Rationally, everyone should take the money and run \u2013 yet psychologists have consistently shown that people will be happy to sacrifice their own cash if they think the offer is unfair, spiting themselves as they punish their partner, just as strong reciprocity would predict.  For Fagundes, queuing exemplifies this principle in modern society. We are all happy to wait our turn without pushing in as long as everyone is treated fairly. But if someone transgresses, we feel an outrage that does not, rationally speaking, fit the crime (and which, if we act on it, will probably only delay us further). And as the strong reciprocator theory also predicts, we may just abandon the queue altogether and form a scrum if we lose faith that others are also cooperating.  Amplifying the queue\u2019s potency, he says, is the fact that the line itself is a \u201csuper-salient signal\u201d. Whether you are waiting at a bar or standing in line of a stadium gig, \u201cthe sight of a thousand or even a few people waiting patiently in line communicates the essence of human cooperation in a way designed to trigger others' instinct for reciprocity,\u201d he notes in his paper. It is perhaps for this reason that people prefer standing in a physical line, rather than being given a numbered ticket, say \u2013 because it reinforces the visual perception of group cooperation.  > The sight of people waiting patiently in line communicates the essence of human cooperation \u2013 Dave Fagundes  Luke Treglown at University College London agrees that it\u2019s a possibility. He points out that we are so sensitive to the \u201cjustice\u201d of the queue that people will react angrily even if no one has actually cheated. We hate it if the line next to us moves faster than our own at an airport check-in, for instance; at a restaurant, we might feel angry if the family behind us are seated at the same time that we are. \u201cWe believe that people in the queue should have to wait for the same amount of time you have waited, regardless of whether it affects your waiting time or not,\u201d he says.  Comparing countries, Treglown points out that the reputations for the strictest queuing etiquette tends to appear in more individualistic societies \u2013 such as Britain, Europe and the USA \u2013 where people tend to be more highly sensitive to apparent inequality between people. Overall, however, he agrees that the cultural differences are not nearly as marked as people imagine. \u201cThe difference between you and me is potentially greater than between me and the average Swedish person, for example,\u201d Treglown says.  In many ways our reputation for queuing is like our apparent interest in the weather: although the British probably don't really talk about the climate more than other nations, the very idea of our obsession has become a conversation point in itself. And that says more about our perception of ourselves and our own culture, and how we would like to be seen, than about our actual behaviour. \u201cNo one likes queueing, but British people have an appreciation of the orderliness and equity that surrounds it,\u201d Treglown says. \u201cThey have this romantic idea of queuing.\u201d  \\--  _David Robson is BBC Future\u2019s feature writer.

Cunard\u2019s RMS Lusitania had been outfitted with a new type of engine that differed from that of its rivals \u2013 and would go on to break the speed record for the fastest ocean crossing not once, but twice.  Between 1850 and 1900, three British passenger lines \u2013 Cunard, Inman and White Star \u2013 dominated transatlantic travel. Toward the end of the century, as increasing numbers of emigrants sought passage to the US and a growing class of Gilded Age travellers demanded speed and luxury, corporate rivalry intensified. Pressure from other European lines forced the British companies to add amenities like swimming pools and restaurants.  Not unlike today's rivalries between, say, aircraft manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing, each raced to make its ocean liners the largest, fastest and most opulent. In the process, they launched the modern age of leisure cruising \u2013 and developed innovations and technologies that continue to be used on cruise ships today.  **Comfort class**  In the mid-19th Century, there were two main players. Inman\u2019s inaugural steamship, launched in 1850, made it the first major British line to replace traditional side-mounted paddlewheels with a screw propeller \u2013 an apparatus with fixed blades turning on a central axis. With the added speed and fuel efficiency this brought, plus a sleek iron hull that was more durable than wood, Inman established itself as a company unafraid to try new technology for faster crossings.  Inman\u2019s main rival, Cunard, focused on safety instead. \u201cThe Cunard way was to let competitors introduce new-fangled technology and let them deal with the setbacks,\u201d says Michael Gallagher, Cunard\u2019s company historian. \u201cOnce that technology had proved itself, only then would Cunard consider using it.\u201d  But Cunard risked being left behind both by Inman and by a new rival which burst onto the scene in 1870 \u2013\u00a0the White Star line\u2019s splashy debut included five huge ocean liners, dubbed \u201cfloating hotels\u201d. Their flagship, RMS Oceanic, launched in 1871 and had efficient compound engines that burned just 58 tonnes of coal per day, compared with 110 tonnes consumed by Inman\u2019s ships. That gave White Star the budget to invest in comfort.  The contrast with Cunard was stark. \u201cWhere Oceanic had bathtubs, Cunard offered a basin; where Oceanic had central heating, Cunard offered stoves; and where Oceanic had lavatories, Cunard managed with chamber pots,\u201d says Gallagher. Architects for Oceanic also moved first-class cabins to mid-ship for less rocking on the waves.  > Where Oceanic had bathtubs, Cunard offered a basin; where Oceanic had central heating, Cunard offered stoves \u2013 Michael Gallagher  In the 1880s and 1890s, each of White Star\u2019s new ships captured the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade which recognises the passenger liner able to make the fastest average speed on a westbound Atlantic crossing. In answer, Inman built SS City of New York and SS City of Paris. The City of Paris won the Blue Riband several times thanks to its expensive but fuel-efficient triple-expansion engines and twin screw propellers. The innovation was a first for an ocean liner, and meant that if one propeller broke, the other could compensate \u2013 finally ending the need for auxiliary sails. This suddenly freed up a lot more space on deck that would later be put to good use by providing luxury facilities for their passengers.  Cunard, meanwhile, ventured into the new world of telecommunications by installing the first Marconi wireless stations, which allowed radio operators to transmit messages at sea, on its sister ships RMS Lucania and RMS Campania. First-class passengers could even book European hotels by wireless before reaching port.  \u201cConnectivity was just as important to passengers in the past as it is today,\u201d says William Roka, historian and public programmes manager at South Street Seaport Museum in New York City.  In 1897, Germany entered the fray. Shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd unveiled its colossal Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse \u2013 which shocked its rivals by taking the Blue Riband from Britain after 52 years. Another German liner, the SS Amerika, wowed its well-heeled guests by introducing the first \u00e0 la carte restaurant at sea: the Ritz-Carlton, brainchild of Paris hotelier Cesar Ritz and renowned chef Auguste Escoffier. It allowed guests to order meals at their leisure and dine with their friends rather than attend rigidly scheduled seatings \u2013 a forerunner of the kind of freestyle dining seen on today\u2019s cruise ships.  To complicate matters, American banking tycoon JP Morgan was buying up smaller companies to create a US-based shipping-and-railroad monopoly. In 1901, White Star became his biggest acquisition. Inman, too, now was US-owned, having been bought by an American company in 1893. Suddenly, the battles weren\u2019t only in the boardrooms: building the world\u2019s top ocean liners was now a point of national pride.  > Building the world\u2019s top ocean liners was now a point of national pride  With the help of a \u00a32.6 million government loan (equivalent to more than \u00a3261 million today), Britain\u2019s Cunard line launched the massive twins RMS Lusitania and RMS Mauretania. Both had the first steam turbine engines of any superliner. To reach its sustained speed of 25 knots (46.25 km/h), the Lusitania had \u201c68 additional furnaces, six more boilers, 52,000 sq ft of heating surface, and an increase of 30,000 horsepower,\u201d reported the New York Times. \u201cIf turbines had not been employed, at least three 20,000-horsepower engines would have been necessary.\u201d  White Star fought back with RMS Olympic, RMS Titanic and HMHS Britannic. Like the Lusitania and Mauretania, White Star\u2019s trio would feature double hulls and watertight bulkheads. With standard reciprocating engines, they were slower than the Cunarders, but surpassed them in size and elegance. The Olympic and another White Star liner, the Adriatic, even debuted the first indoor swimming pools at sea. A first-class passenger \u201cmay indulge in Turkish and electric baths, take recreation in the gymnasium or [with] a squash racket or divert himself in the swimming pond,\u201d marvelled one newspaper.  > A first-class passenger may indulge in Turkish and electric baths, take recreation in the gymnasium or divert himself in the swimming pond  \u201cIt was fun for the first-class passengers to send postcards back home saying, \u2018Writing to you from the deck of the world\u2019s biggest ship, wish you were here,\u2019\u201d says historian William H Miller Jr.  History changed course when Titanic hit an iceberg on 14 April 1912 and sank on her first transatlantic voyage. As a result of the tragedy, safety regulations were updated to require lifeboat berths for every passenger and 24-hour radio surveillance (rules which are still in place).  But there were more challenges to come. World War One broke out in 1914 and European governments requisitioned liners for war service. Then a German submarine torpedoed Lusitania off the coast of Ireland on 7 May 1915, killing more than a thousand of those on board.  **Cruising on**  Despite a post-war liner-building boom, US anti-immigration laws reduced the number of transatlantic emigrants \u2013 the liners\u2019 bread and butter \u2013 in the 1920s.  \u201cShips only made money when there were passengers aboard,\u201d says David Perry, a maritime historian. \u201cThe companies needed to do something to stay afloat, so they created the tourists.\u201d  > Cunard sent the Mauretania to the tropics as the first cruise ship catering to the new class of passengers  Cunard modernised the aging Mauretania to burn oil instead of coal (most liners were converted to burn oil after World War One), painted its dark hull white to reflect the sunlight and sent her to the tropics as the first cruise ship catering to the new class of passengers: US vacationers who wanted a holiday at sea, replete with the nostalgic glamour of yesteryear. \u201cCruising offered a way for steamship companies to keep using their older transatlantic vessels and [make] additional revenue,\u201d says Roka.  After the Depression forced a struggling Cunard and White Star to merge, the new Cunard-White Star built the immense RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. To compete with German, American and French liners, designers ratcheted up the creature comforts, like air-conditioning and private bathrooms in every stateroom. The Italian liners Conte de Savoia and Rex featured the first outdoor swimming pools \u201cwith real sand around them to make it look beachy \u2013 completely over the top,\u201d Perry says. By 1957, more people crossed the Atlantic by ship than ever before.  But by the following year, jet passengers outnumbered them.  \u201cCunard said flying was a fad,\u201d Miller says. \u201cBut if, like the company slogan said, \u2018Getting there is half the fun\u2019, then getting there faster was a lot more fun.\u201d  Air travel and high operating costs doomed most transatlantic liners by the 1970s \u2013 only Cunard\u2019s RMS Queen Mary 2 makes regular transatlantic crossings now.  Even so, cruising itself grew more popular over the ensuing decades. And not only does the idea of leisure cruising stem from these early days of competition, but so do many of the specific features of today\u2019s massive ships.  Today\u2019s vessels still feature oil-burning engines, though the power and propulsion systems are much more sophisticated. Modern perks like barbershops and beauty salons, freestyle dining, pools and libraries all were introduced on the original \u201cfloating palaces.\u201d Even internet communication has its roots in the wireless rooms aboard the great ocean liners.  But the most important similarity may be the most basic.  \u201cThe feeling of the deck under your feet is the same,\u201d says Perry. \u201cThat\u2019s the transformative power of a voyage at sea.\u201d  _This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

From movies such as The Hunt for Red October to long-running TV series like Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, they have always been portrayed as awesome instruments of geopolitical power gliding quietly through the gloomy deep on secret, serious missions.  But at the end of their useful lives the subs essentially become floating nuclear hazards, fizzing with lethal, spent nuclear fuel that's extremely hard to get out. Nuclear navies have had to go to extraordinary lengths to cope with their bloated and ageing Cold War fleets of hunter-killer and ballistic missile nuclear subs.  As a result, some of the strangest industrial graveyards on the planet have been created \u2013 stretching from the US Pacific Northwest, via the Arctic Circle to Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet home of Vladivostok.  These submarine cemeteries take many forms. At the filthy end of the spectrum, in the Kara Sea north of Siberia, they are essentially nuclear dumping grounds, with submarine reactors and fuel strewn across the 300m-deep seabed. Here the Russians appear to have continued, until the early 1990s, disposing of their nuclear subs in the same manner as their diesel-powered compatriots: dropping them into the ocean.  **Rusting remains**  The diesel sub scrapyard in the inlets around Olenya Bay in north-west Russia's arctic Kola Peninsula is an arresting sight: rusted-through prows expose torpedo tubes inside, corroded conning towers keel over at bizarre angles and hulls are burst asunder, like mussels smashed on rocks by gulls.  The Soviets turned the Kara Sea into \"an aquarium of radioactive junk\" says Norway\u2019s Bellona Foundation, an environmental watchdog based in Oslo. The seabed is littered with some 17,000 naval radioactive waste containers, 16 nuclear reactors and five complete nuclear submarines \u2013 one has both its reactors still fully fuelled.  The Kara Sea area is now a target for oil and gas companies \u2013 and accidental drilling into such waste could, in principle, breach reactor containments or fuel rod cladding, and release radionuclides into the fishing grounds, warns Bellona's managing director Nils Bohmer.  Official submarine graveyards are much more visible: you can even see them on Google Maps or Google Earth. Zoom in on America's biggest nuclear waste repository in Hanford, Washington, Sayda Bay in the arctic Kola Peninsula, or the shipyards near Vladivostok and you'll see them. There are row after row of massive steel canisters, each around 12m long. They are lined up in ranks in Hanford's long, earthen pits awaiting a future mass burial, sitting in regimented rows on a Sayda Bay dockside, or floating on the waters of the Sea of Japan, shackled to a pier at the Pavlovks sub base near Vladivostok.  **Drained and removed**  These canisters are all that remain of hundreds of nuclear subs. Known as \"three-compartment units\" they are the sealed, de-fuelled reactor blocks produced in a decommissioning process perfected at the US Department of Defense's Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington.  It\u2019s a meticulous process. First, the defunct sub is towed to a secure de- fuelling dock where its reactor compartment is drained of all liquids to expose its spent nuclear fuel assemblies. Each assembly is then removed and placed in spent nuclear fuel casks and put on secure trains for disposal at a long-term waste storage and reprocessing plant. In the US, this is the Naval Reactor Facility at the sprawling Idaho National Laboratory, and in Russia the Mayak plutonium production and reprocessing plant in Siberia is the final destination.  Although the reactor machinery \u2013 steam generators, pumps, valves and piping \u2013 now contains no enriched uranium, the metals in it are rendered radioactive by decades of neutron bombardment shredding their atoms. So after fuel removal, the sub is towed into dry dock where cutting tools and blowtorches are used to sever the reactor compartment, plus an emptied compartment either side of it, from the submarine's hull. Then thick steel seals are welded to either end. So the canisters are not merely receptacles: they are giant high-pressure steel segments of the nuclear submarine itself \u2013 all that remains of it, in fact, as all nonradioactive submarine sections are then recycled.  Russia also uses this technique because the West feared that its less rigorous decommissioning processes risked fissile materials getting into unfriendly hands. At Andreeva Bay, near Sayda, for instance, Russia still stores spent fuel from 90 subs from the 1960s and 1970s, for instance. So in 2002, the G8 nations started a 10-year, $20bn programme to transfer Puget Sound's decommissioning knowhow to the Russian Federation. That involved vastly improving technology and storage at their de-fuelling facility in Severodvinsk and their dismantling facility, and by building a land-based storage dock for the decommissioned reactors.  **Floating menace**  Safer land-based storage matters because the reactor blocks had been left afloat at Sayda Bay, as the air-filled compartments either side of the reactor compartment provide buoyancy, says Bohmer. But at Pavlovks, near Vladivostok, 54 of the canisters are still afloat and at the mercy of the weather.  Decommissioning this way is not always possible, however, says Bohmer. Some Soviet subs had liquid metal cooled reactors \u2013 using a lead-bismuth mixture to remove heat from the core \u2013 rather than the common pressurised water reactor (PWR). In a cold, defunct reactor the lead-bismuth coolant freezes, turning it into an unwieldy solid block. Bohmer says two such submarines are not yet decommissioned and have had to be moved to an extremely remote dockyard at Gremikha Bay \u2013 also on the Kola Peninsula \u2013 for safety's sake.  Using the three-compartment-unit method, Russia has so far decommissioned 120 nuclear submarines of the Northern Fleet and 75 subs from its Pacific Fleet. In the US, meanwhile, 125 Cold War-era subs have been dismantled this way. France, too, has used the same procedure. In Britain, however, Royal Navy nuclear subs are designed so that the reactor module can be removed without having to sever compartments from the midsection. \"The reactor pressure vessel can be removed in one piece, encased, transported and stored,\" says a spokesman for the UK Ministry of Defence.  However Britain's plans to decommission 12 defunct submarines stored at Devonport in the south of England and seven at Rosyth in Scotland won't happen any time soon as the government still has to decide which of five possible UK sites will eventually store those pressure vessels and spent fuel. This has raised community concerns as the numbers of defunct nuclear-fuelled subs is building up at Devonport and Rosyth, as BBC News reported last year.  **Water fears**  Environmental groups have also raised concerns about fuel storage in the US. The Idaho National Lab has been the ultimate destination for all US Navy high- level spent fuel since the first nuclear sub, USS Nautilus, was developed in 1953. \"The prototype reactor for the USS Nautilus was tested at INL and since then every scrap of spent fuel from the nuclear navy has ended up in Idaho. It is stored above the upstream end of the Snake River Aquifer, the second largest unified underground body of water on the North American continent,\" says Beatrice Brailsford of the Snake River Alliance, an environmental lobby group.  \"The spent fuel is stored above ground, but the rest of the waste is buried above the aquifer and that practice may continue for another half century. It is a source of concern for many people in Idaho.\" It's not only the aquifer's fresh water that's at risk: the state\u2019s signature crop, potatoes, would also be affected.  Even with high security, radioactive material can occasionally escape \u2013 sometimes in bizarre ways. For instance both INL and Hanford have suffered unusual radiation leaks from tumbleweeds blowing into waste cooling ponds, picking up contaminated water, and then being blown over the facility's perimeter by the wind.  The expensive, long-term measures that have to be taken to render a defunct nuclear sub safe don\u2019t seem to deter military planners from building more vessels. \"As far as the US is concerned there is no indication that the Navy believes nuclear submarines have been anything less than a stellar success and replacements for the major submarine classes are in the works.\" says Edwin Lyman, nuclear policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a pressure group, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The US is not alone: Russia has four new nuclear subs under construction at Severodvinsk and may build a further eight before 2020. \"Despite limited budgets Russia is committed to building up its nuclear fleet again,\" says Bohmer. China is doing likewise.  The submarine graveyards and spent fuel stores, it appears, will continue to be busy.  _Share this story on_\u00a0_Facebook__,_\u00a0_Google+_\u00a0_or_\u00a0_Twitter__._  Read more:  _Secrets of the desert aircraft boneyards_", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - How do you dismantle a nuclear submarine?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150330-where-nuclear-subs-go-to-die", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "United Kingdom", "Japan", "China", "France", "Russia", "Norway", "United States", "Canada", "Germany", "Italy", "Australia"], "author": "Paul Marks"},{"newsText": "A dimpled chunk of dark-coloured iron sits on Richard Dinan\u2019s desk at his office in central London. He insists it is not just an expensive paperweight.  This malformed lump, forged in the heart of a star billions of years ago, is a meteorite. It is also what gave Dinan the idea for his latest business venture.  The millionaire, who found fame as a playboy entrepreneur on the reality television show Made in Chelsea, runs a discount card business and 3D printing company. Now, however, he is eyeing something far more ambitious: nuclear fusion.  For decades, fusion power has been an almost fanciful dream of those hoping to crack the world's energy problems. Nuclear fusion powers the stars and burns in the heart of our own Sun. Here on Earth, it could provide an almost limitless, safe and clean source of energy.  But it has remained frustratingly out of reach. Physicists have been attempting to turn nuclear fusion into a viable power source since the 1950s. There is a joke in the energy community that the world is just 30 years away from benefiting from nuclear fusion power\u2026 and that it always has been and always will be.  Fusion is the process of fusing the nuclei of two small atoms together to form a larger one. It takes huge amounts of energy to cause this to happen, but when it does, even greater amounts of energy can be released. Achieving fusion itself was never really the problem \u2013 humans have been able to trigger thermonuclear fusion reactions ever since the first hydrogen bomb was set off in 1952. The real challenge has been how to harness the awesome energy it releases.  > Achieving fusion itself was never really the problem  Governments around the world have ploughed billions into fusion projects, building vast machines which heat gas to temperatures many times that of the sun. There have been some successes. The Joint European Torus experiment known as Jet, at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire, England, demonstrated in 1991 that it is possible to release power from nuclear fusion in a controlled environment. It released 16 megawatts (MW) of power \u2013 enough to boil 6,400 kettles. But it required 25 MW of power to trigger the fusion reaction.  This step, however, led 35 countries to commit to building a new, larger reactor based on the same design in the south of France. Known as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter), its aim is to generate more energy by triggering a reaction that will sustain itself.  The project has been hit by almost a decade of delays and overspending. Initially slated for 5 billion euros (\u00a34.3 billion), the cost has nearly tripled to an estimated 14 billion euros (\u00a312 billion).  **Capital idea**  As a result, private investors including Dinan believe they can edge into the field. \u201cTechnology has moved on considerably since Iter was designed,\u201d Dinan says. \u201cI have no new physics for the world. My trick is that I can build technology quickly and cheaply.\u201d  > I have no new physics for the world. My trick is that I can build technology quickly and cheaply \u2013 Richard Dinan  Dinan\u2019s plan is to build smaller, more compact reactors that will cost a fraction of that needed for Iter. Like the other private ventures trying to get onboard the fusion bandwagon, he argues that as nimble enterprises, they are better placed to solve these problems more quickly than big, expensive public projects. He believes advances in supercomputing and rapid 3D printing technologies will allow him to build reactors in far shorter timescales, too. With \u00a3200 million he hopes to raise from investors, he plans to build two reactors within the next seven years.  Although it would be easy to dismiss Dinan as a dreamer, his startup Applied Fusion Systems is one of a growing number of firms investing in the promise of fusion. In the UK alone, there are at least two other companies trying to produce commercial nuclear fusion power stations. And as BBC Future reported last year, in the US, several projects have received the backing of wealthy technology billionaires including Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and former Google vice president Mike Cassidy.  After all, with the prospect of climate change making fossil fuel use unsustainable, there is a hunger for other sources of power. But renewable sources like solar and wind are not yet fully reliable and nuclear fission remains unpopular because of the harmful waste it produces.  \u201cI\u2019m not surprised there are an increasing number of private investors willing to put money into fusion,\u201d says Ian Chapman, head of the UK Atomic Energy Authority and Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. \u201cYou have this source of energy that has incredibly high yield, no radioactive waste, it requires little land use, has an effectively inexhaustible fuel supply and is continuous.\u201d  In other words, there is a lot of money that could be made.  When Iter turns on \u2013 currently scheduled to happen in 2025 \u2013 it is expected to have the capacity to produce 500 MW, 10 times the energy needed to trigger a fusion reaction. But whether that actually will happen remains to be seen. \u201cWe are still at the stage of trying to demonstrate it is possible to get more power out than you put in, and that it can be done on a commercial scale,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cPrivate industry is still someway behind that, as far as we can tell.\u201d  If Iter is successful, however, it will be the start of a fundamental shift in the world\u2019s energy landscape. Dinan, like other companies in the industry, believes those who already know how to build reactors will reap the greatest rewards.  \u201cWhen Iter works, the appetite for fusion will be huge,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be the biggest innovation of our generation and it is going to be companies that are starting in the fusion business now that others will come to.\u201d  **Powering on**  Dinan\u2019s approach to cracking fusion draws on research conducted by scientists at Culham over the years. Dinan\u2019s company is planning to build a spherical tokamak based on the design of an experimental reactor at Culham, the \u00a340 million Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (Mast). Tokamak reactors work by heating hydrogen atoms to the point where they form a plasma \u2013 a super-hot, electrically-charged gas. Powerful magnetic fields levitate this glowing ion soup and help squeeze the plasma together, increasing the chance of collisions that lead to fusion.  The Mast design is a squashed, rounder version of the tokamak reactor being built for Iter, and theoretically should require less energy to contain the fusion reaction.  But achieving the conditions for fusion means heating two types of hydrogen, known as deuterium and tritium, more than 100,000,000C \u2013 six times the temperature at the centre of the Sun. Heating the fuel takes huge amounts of energy. Even more energy is required to power the magnets to keep this resulting plasma away from the walls of the reactor, which easily could melt at these temperatures.  Mast has generated plasmas with temperatures of up to 23,000,000C inside its 4m-wide stainless steel reaction vessel, but still falls short of the temperatures needed for full fusion.  \u201cWe want to build several of these and test out our ideas,\u201d says James Lambert, head of operations at Applied Fusion Systems. \u201cIt is unlikely that our first reactor will produce a net energy gain, but we are aiming for an electrical output of 100 MW or just below.\u201d  Lambert says simulations run on supercomputers will help model how the plasma will behave inside the reactor, speeding up the design process. In the meantime, they are working on methods to 3D print the components, allowing for a faster testing schedule. \u201cPlasma behaves in unpredictable ways,\u201d says Lambert. \u201cNow that the price of supercomputing has plummeted, it is giving fusion researchers the ability to test their ideas before building them.\u201d  > Now that the price of supercomputing has plummeted, it is giving fusion researchers the ability to test their ideas before building them \u2013 James Lambert  Applied Fusion Systems are entering an increasingly competitive market. One of the oldest fusion energy companies is Oxfordshire-based Tokamak Energy, established in 2009. They are also looking to use the spherical tokamak design to create small-scale fusion reactor power stations.  \u201cIf you go back 20 years, people were still thinking about creating fusion reactors that would generate a large base load with several gigawatts of power,\u201d says David Kingham, Tokamak Energy\u2019s chief executive. \u201cNow they are looking at a much more distributed power supply where smaller power plants on the 100 MW scale are more attractive.\u201d  Tokamak Energy is on the verge of completing their third test reactor \u2013 a 2 .5m-tall device swathed in copper magnets. They hope to generate plasmas heated to 15,000,000C later this year; by 2019, they aim to increase that temperature closer to the 100,000,000C needed for fusion.  \u201cEnough is known about the physics to get these machines to work,\u201d says Kingham. \u201cIt is getting down to a series of engineering challenges now.\u201d  A spin-out company from the University of Oxford, First Light Fusion, is taking a different approach. It is hoping to exploit a technique called inertial confinement fusion, where lasers are fired at a pellet of fuel to compress it until the atoms fuse. However, this technique only ever has been able to achieve about one-third of the conditions needed to ignite a fusion reaction.  **California dreaming**  Despite this setback, fusion has captured the imagination of wealthy Silicon Valley and internet billionaires looking for their own version of the moonshot. One example is Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who has helped bankroll California-based Tri Alpha Energy. Over the past 20 years the company has developed a reactor that fires beams of high-energy plasma at each other inside a reaction chamber. Rather than using isotopes of hydrogen as the fusion fuel, they are looking to use a form of boron instead \u2013 but this will require far higher temperatures to start the reaction.  Another approach is being taken by Canadian firm General Fusion, backed by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos. A 3m-wide reaction chamber bristles with 220 pistons which will create a shockwave when they fire simultaneously. This will send a spinning vortex of liquid lead and lithium crashing into two rings of plasma that have been accelerated towards each other.  Still, significant challenges remain.  \u201cIn the middle of these reactors you have a fuel that is 10 times hotter than the centre of the Sun,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cYou have to have stable and safe way to get the exhaust heat escaping from the plasma out of the reactor without melting any parts of it.\u201d  > A fusion reactor will be the most intense source of neutrons on Earth \u2013 Ian Chapman  Fusion reactions also release subatomic particles called neutrons which fly out and smash into the walls of the reactor, taking a toll on even the toughest metals. \u201cA fusion reactor will be the most intense source of neutrons on Earth,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cWe need to be able to understand how these will affect the materials we use to make the reactor. That is complex science.\u201d  Scientists at Culham are working on solutions, including a \u00a330 million upgrade to the Mast reactor which uses new configurations of magnets to distribute the heat over a wider area. Meanwhile, Dinan already is looking at a number of sites on the outskirts of London that he hopes will be suitable for his reactors.  \u201cIt is very exciting to be part of this field right now,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cIt feels like we are finally entering the era when we will see the promise of fusion being delivered.\u201d  _This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

It was the last leg of the new scheduled British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) jet passenger flight between London and Johannesburg.  Some 36 hours later, with a new crew on board, the aircraft took off from Rome for the second stage of its return journey to South Africa. It began to climb to its cruising altitude. Shortly after passing Naples, over the island of Stromboli at the southern tip of Italy, the aircraft disintegrated. Seven crew and 14 passengers were killed.  It was the second mid-air explosion of a Comet in three months.  \u201cI still do not forgive those who restarted the services after the [first] crash,\u201d says Duffey, now retired and living in Canada. \u201cThey gambled and lost; I was one of the chips.\u201d  The first Comet was rolled out of its hangar at the de Havilland factory in Hatfield, some 25 miles (40 kilometres) \u00a0north of central London, in July 1949 \u2013 only four years after the end of World War Two.  Passenger aircraft of the time were low-flying and uncomfortable to ride. With unpressurised cabins and propellers powered by noisy piston engines, they had to fly through, rather than above, the weather. Many were converted from wartime bombers or freight transport aircraft and had quaint old-fashioned names such as Tudor, Lancastrian and Argonaut.  The Comet, on the other hand, looked like an aircraft from the future, with a mirrored aluminium fuselage and swept back wings concealing four jet engines. Along each side were large rectangular picture windows to afford passengers unprecedented views of the Earth from a cruising altitude of up to 40,000ft (12 kilometres).  > It was the Concorde of its day \u2013 it flew higher, faster, smoother than any other airline of that time and made everything else obsolete \u2013 Alistair Hodgson, de Havilland Museum  \u201cIt still looks modern,\u201d says Alistair Hodgson, curator of the de Havilland Aircraft Museum. \u201cIt was clean, it was aerodynamic and it looked like it would slip through the air perfectly \u2013 and of course, that\u2019s what it did.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in the aviation industry that if an aeroplane looks right, it\u2019ll fly right,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIt was the Concorde of its day \u2013 it flew higher, faster, smoother than any other airline of that time and made everything else obsolete.\u201d  Inside there were seats for 36 passengers in two cabins. Those in first class were seated around tables \u2013 much like in a railway carriage. Apart from the cockpit, the rest of the fuselage was taken up by a large galley, luggage storage areas (there was no hold underneath) and separate toilets for ladies and gentlemen.  \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you allow engineers to design aircraft, rather than accountants,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIf you look at a modern no-frills airline, every inch of space is given over to fare-paying passengers but that\u2019s not what air travel was like in the 1940s.  \u201cAir travel was just in its final days of being a thing for the rich only,\u201d he says. \u201cThe primary way of travelling long distances was ocean liners.\u201d In fact, many of the passengers of BOAC were civil servants off to run the British Empire.  After almost two years of test flights, the Comet made its first scheduled flight on 2 May 1952, flying \u2013 via Rome, Beirut, Khartoum, Entebbe and Livingstone \u2013 to Johannesburg. The flight, taking just over 23 hours, was a triumph. Passengers reported a smooth journey, superb service and beautifully presented meals.  With no other passenger jets yet in service, the Comet was the envy of the world. \u201cThe Comet fleet considered themselves the elite in BOAC,\u201d says Hugh Dibley, a pilot with the airline in the 1960s. \u201cIt even had its own special call-sign: \u2018Jet Speedbird\u2019.\u201d  Within months, BOAC had added flights to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Karachi, Singapore and Tokyo. Meanwhile, de Havilland was notching up new orders for its remarkable aircraft from Canadian Pacific, Air France and the Royal Canadian Air Force.  > The first four aircraft had faulty seals - we used to carry hydraulic fluid to top up the system \u2013 Peter Duffey, Comet pilot  At speeds of up to 500mph (807km/h), passengers were experiencing the ride of their life. But for those sitting at the sharp end, there were few flights that were without incident.  \u201cAll my time on the Comet 1, the aircraft was still under development,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cWe had problem after problem.\u201d  The Comet was the first commercial airliner with hydraulic flying controls, which worked much like the brake pedal on a car. When the pilot moved the control column, it activated a pump which pushed fluid through a circuit of pipes to adjust the control surfaces on the wings.  \u201cThe first four aircraft had faulty seals,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cWe used to carry hydraulic fluid to top up the system.\u201d  Crews also reported a host of other problems. The electrics and navigation system tended to overheat. The cockpit\u2019s windows would mist up. And the aircraft\u2019s range was limited to four hours before it needed to be refuelled. But there was also a more fundamental problem with the design of the controls.  \u201cNo matter what speed you were doing, the feedback on the control column felt the same,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cIt was a danger handling the aircraft, without a doubt I think that led to one of the accidents.\u201d  On 26 October 1952, Duffey was off-shift sipping red wine in Rome\u2019s airport terminal after flying Comet G-ALYZ in from Beirut, Lebanon. Looking out of the window, he watched the plane begin its take-off for the flight to London.  \u201cWe saw the aircraft run off the end of the runway,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo we dashed out, got a jeep and drove out to where it was and it was just sitting there hissing \u2013 it ripped the belly tank out and there was fuel everywhere.\u201d  > As pilots we were becoming very concerned \u2013 Peter Duffey  Incredibly, there was no fire and none of the crew or 35 passengers were injured. \u201cWhat [the captain] had done was raise the nose too much on take-off; it had too much drag on the wings and didn\u2019t get fully airborne,\u201d Duffey says.  The pilot was blamed for the crash, but the incident also exposed an inherent flaw with the design. \u201cThe cause of the accident wasn\u2019t only the wing but the lack of feedback on the controls that allowed you to pull-back as much as you wanted,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cIt would never have happened if the test pilots had tested that aircraft properly.\u201d  A few months later, on 13 March 1953, a similar problem occurred on take-off from Karachi. This time a Comet on a training flight, smashed into a stone bridge and burst into flames. All 11 crew members and technicians on board were killed. And then, in June, another plane was damaged at Dakar, Senegal in a similar incident.  \u201cAs pilots we were becoming very concerned,\u201d says Duffey. \u201cAnd we started to take a very active interest in what was going on.\u201d  On 2 May 1953, 43 people died when a Comet crashed shortly after leaving Delhi in India. An investigation revealed the plane had broken apart after flying into extreme turbulence.  As a result of these incidents, new advisory take-off instructions were issued to pilots, adjustments were made to the wing design and future models of the plane would be fitted with weather radar.  But worse was to come.  \u201cThere were two fatal flaws with the aircraft,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cFirst was the method of construction \u2013 the skin of the aircraft was made as thin as possible to save weight.\u201d  \u201cThe Comet flew very high, and it needed to be pressurised so the passengers inside can breathe,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIf you do that, it\u2019s like taking a toy balloon and blowing it up and deflating it constantly \u2013 eventually it\u2019s going to tear.\u201d  > Fishermen reported hearing multiple explosions before seeing burning debris plunge through the clouds  The second problem concerned the rectangular windows. \u201cIf you have a square opening in a sheet of metal, like the skin of an airliner, and you stress it, the place where the crack is going to start is at the corner,\u201d Hodgson explains.  On 10 January 1954, Comet G-ALYP took off from Rome and climbed into the clouds. During a radio call to report the weather, the transmission suddenly cut off. Below, fishermen reported hearing multiple explosions before seeing burning debris plunge through the clouds. All 29 passengers and six crew were killed.  All BOAC and Air France Comets were immediately grounded while the wreckage was recovered and investigations got underway. More than 50 modifications were ordered on the aircraft but investigators could not identify a single cause of the disaster.  \u201cWe had a series of meetings at Heathrow,\u201d says BOAC pilot Duffey. \u201cThey said they were quite sure they\u2019d covered what was going on.\u201d  The meeting was asked to vote. \u201cBy a majority of one, we decided to go back into service,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted against because I felt the modifications had not adequately discovered the reason for the explosion.\u201d  Unfortunately, he was proved right.  When Comet G-ALYY later exploded in mid-air on 8 April, all Comets around the world were grounded again.  \u201cIt must have been an earthquake through the industry, because everyone was looking to de Havilland and Britain as the pioneers of fast, high and comfortable air travel,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIt was a huge mystery why these superb and futuristic aircraft were suddenly falling out of the sky.\u201d  \u201cI felt so aggrieved that they put it back into service,\u201d says Duffey, \u201cthat I joined [the pilot union] Balpa on a more or less full time basis, determined to make sure we knew what was going on with aircraft we were operating.\u201d  > Over the equivalent of 9,000 flying hours, the water pressure in the aircraft fuselage was raised and lowered to simulate the conditions it would experience during flight  A team of experts was assembled at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough for an unprecedented investigation into the crashes. The process marked the birth of today\u2019s global air accident investigation industry.  \u201cIt was obvious from the wreckage that the aircraft had explosively disintegrated in some way,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just test an aircraft by making it do that again, so they immersed the aircraft in a very large tank of water and then started the stress tests and pressure tests.\u201d  Over the equivalent of 9,000 flying hours, the water pressure in the aircraft fuselage was raised and lowered to simulate the conditions it would experience during flight. Then, after six weeks, the pressure suddenly dropped. The metal had cracked around one of the windows and the fuselage had blown open.  It was clear that the fuselage was too thin and the rectangular windows were a source of stress. The world\u2019s first jet airliner had to be completely redesigned. With the Comet out of service, the rest of the airline industry suddenly had a chance to catch up.  \u201cAll the time, your competitors are looking over your shoulder at what you do,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cThey were all learning the lessons and coming up with designs that didn\u2019t have the inherent flaws of the original de Havilland design.\u201d  With the comet grounded, the aircraft that would transform the way we travel was taking shape in Seattle. Flown for the first time in July 1954, the Boeing 707 went into service in 1958. The company eventually built more than 1,000 of these iconic aircraft.  Back in the UK, de Havilland developed the Comet 2 and 3, before releasing the Comet 4 to the airlines by the end of 1958. Longer \u2013 comfortably carrying 92 passengers \u2013 stronger, more powerful and with much safer oval-shaped windows, it had a range of 2,500 miles, making it ideal for medium-haul flights.  > It was beautiful to fly and land but it was too late \u2013 Peter Duffey  \u201cThe Comet 4 was powerful, strong and reliable,\u201d says Hugh Dibley, who began his flying career on the aircraft. \u201cIt was a lovely aircraft to fly in.\u201d  Duffey agrees. \u201cIt was a super aircraft,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was beautiful to fly and land but it was too late.\u201d  Although the 707 was winning most of the major airline orders, BOAC, flying Comet 4s, still managed to achieve the first commercial transatlantic crossing in a jet airliner - twice. On 4 October 1958, Comet 4s left New York and Heathrow. Although the US bound flight had to stop to refuel in Newfoundland, the London flight made the journey non-stop in six hours and 11 minutes.  Comet 4s flew with BOAC until 1965 and with British airline Dan Air until 1980. The class was adapted into the hugely successful French Caravelle aircraft as well as the Nimrod reconnaissance plane, which continued to fly well into this century. The Comet 4 only finished its flying days in 1997.  Duffey, who had narrowly escaped two fatal Comet crashes, went on to become one of British Airways\u2019 first Concorde pilots.  The British aircraft industry never fully recovered from the Comet\u2019s dramatic failures. Today, the site of the de Havilland factory in Hatfield is an industrial park. The administrative offices are a police station, the entrance building a KFC, and the hangar where the Comet first flew from is a gym \u2013 the floor now covered in tennis courts.  The only surviving original Comet 1 is being renovated at the de Havilland Museum \u2013 a small volunteer-run collection of buildings and hangars in the countryside north of London. When BBC Future meets team leader Peter Kay, he\u2019s working to re-install the ladies\u2019 toilet.  > It\u2019s the only one in the world, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to make sure it survives and people can see it \u2013 Peter Kay, Comet restoration team  \u201cWe\u2019ve had to start from scratch internally,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn places the aluminium of the fuselage had corroded so you could see holes through it.\u201d  Over the past five years, the volunteers have lined the interior and have begun rebuilding the cabin and cockpit. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one in the world, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to make sure it survives and people can see it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what they were doing 70 years ago, they were way ahead of their time.\u201d  Although ultimately, Boeing triumphed in the race to produce a mass-market passenger jet and subsequent generations of aircraft have made flying safer, cheaper and widely available, the legacy of this British pioneer lives on.  \u201cToday\u2019s jet aircraft owe a huge amount to the Comet,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cIt taught the lessons that the other manufacturers learned and paved the way for modern safety and design.\u201d  The Comet still looks like an aircraft from the future. Sitting on one of comfy upholstered seats of the First Class apartment, it is easy to imagine what it must have been like to fly in one of these beautiful aircraft high above the weather, maybe reading a magazine or sipping an iced drink.

The measures are outlined in the Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill.  Ministers says they want to ensure it is easy for accident victims to claim compensation if a collision occurs when the cars are in automatic mode.  Insurers could still try to recover their costs from the vehicles' makers.  However, the bill - which applies to England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland - makes two exemptions.  If a vehicle's owner has made unauthorised changes to the car's software or fails to install an update that their policy requires them to, then they become liable.  It is proposed the Department of Transport will determine which cars will be classed as self-driving and become subject to the requirements.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The law would ensure both car owners and pedestrians could easily make a claim if in an accident involving a self-driving vehicle  The suggestions have been welcomed by the insurance industry.  \"It demonstrates the government's clear commitment to moving forward when it comes to automated vehicles,\" said Ben Howarth, senior policy adviser at the Association of British Insurers.  \"As an industry, we want to keep insurance as straightforward as possible, which is why insurers proposed the simple approach which the government is now taking forward.\"  ## 'Big transition'  Self-driving cars are already being tested on UK roads.  But many car companies predict it will be a decade or more before they begin to sell or rent fully autonomous cars to the general public.  Even so, the government believes the country will benefit from having related laws put in place in advance.  \"It will... enable consumers in the United Kingdom to be amongst the first in the world to reap the rewards that improved transport technology will bring,\" the bill states.  \"Putting the United Kingdom at the forefront of the most modern transport revolution will create new jobs and fuel economic growth around the country.\"  Image caption The government may require some businesses to install electric car chargers  Other measures outlined by the bill include powers to:    * compel petrol stations and large retailers to offer electric power charging points    * require car charging point operators to publish details of their prices, locations and opening hours as well as details of which equipment is in working order   * instruct charging point operators to make sure the kit meets certain specifications to ensure it is compatible with a wide range of cars and is resilient to hack attacks  Some businesses may resist being made to invest in the technology at an early stage, but one expert welcomed the fact the government might require them to do so.  \"When you've got a big transition to a new technology, the market can take a long time to do what's required,\" said Prof David Bailey, from Aston Business School.  \"So, I think this is about trying to stimulate things more quickly than would happen otherwise.\"", "newsHeadline": "Self-driving cars must be covered by insurance, says UK bill - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39055395", "countriesMentioned": ["United States", "Canada", "United Kingdom"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p04n9q37.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionFaraday Future says its car can accelerate at a faster pace than Tesla's vehicles  Start-up Faraday Future has unveiled a self-driving electric car that it says can accelerate from zero to 60mph (97km/h) in 2.39 seconds.  Faraday says the FF91 accelerates faster than Tesla's Model S or any other electric car in production.  It was shown off at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.  But Faraday Future has faced financial difficulties and one analyst said it had to challenge \"scepticism\" following last year's CES presentation.  The FF91 was introduced via a live demo, in which it drove itself around a car park and backed into an empty space.  Pre-recorded footage also showed the car accelerating from standstill to 60mph in 2.39 seconds.  Tesla's fastest model did it in 2.5 seconds on the same track.  Late in the presentation, however, there was an awkward moment when Chinese billionaire Jia Yueting tried to demonstrate the car's self-parking function on stage in front of the audience.  This time, the vehicle remained stationary.  Mr Jia is chief executive of LeEco - a Chinese video-on-demand and smartphone- maker - which has invested in Faraday.  \"OK, it seems like it's a little bit lazy tonight,\" said Faraday senior vice president Nick Sampson, as the car refused to respond. It eventually complied later when they made a second attempt.  Image copyright Faraday Future  Faraday plans to release the FF91 in 2018. To pre-order, hopefuls will need to provide a refundable $5,000 (\u00a34,080) deposit.  The event came a year after the firm's first press conference, where it showed off a futuristic-looking concept vehicle. Several commentators criticised it at the time for failing to give more detail about what it was actually working on.  ## Car ID  Prospective buyers were told they would be able to connect to the forthcoming car via a virtual \"FFID\" account.  With this, Mr Sampson explained, it would be possible to share data - such as movies or route plans - to the car from personal computers, for example.  * * *  Image copyright Faraday Future  ## Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, at CES in Las Vegas  Tech launches are famed for their awkward exchanges on stage, but the dynamic between Faraday Future's Nick Sampson and LeEco boss Jia Yueting was on another level.  Sampson is the company's figurehead at events like this, glitzy launches where big promises are made. Mr Jia holds the financial keys to keep the Faraday Future project going - the money from his China-based firm is bankrolling the efforts here (at least, we think it is - neither firm will discuss the nature of the deal).  So when the newly-launched car failed to drive itself a few feet in front of the audience, Sampson was almost apologetic to Mr Jia. For the audience, it suddenly felt like we'd stumbled into a product pitch meeting and were watching Sampson pick up the pieces.  In the unscientific poll I conducted shortly after the presentation, all felt the design of the FF91 fell short of Tesla's vehicles in the style-stakes. As I type this, Elon Musk is yet to offer any reaction to his newest competitor. I don't think he'll be losing any sleep. Experience has shown him that making the car is the easy bit - producing it on en masse is far more difficult.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC  * * *  Faraday Future has lately been in the news for less celebratory reasons - its troubled finances.  In November, it confirmed that work had stopped on a huge factory in Las Vegas intended to manufacture a car backed by investment from LeEco.  A week earlier, the Bloomberg news agency had revealed that Mr Jia had written to LeEco's employees to say his firm's finances were under pressure.

He added its range would extend to 482 miles (775km) when driven at 55mph.  Many analysts expect interest in electric vehicles to continue to rise in coming years.  \"We estimate around one in 10 vehicles will be electric or hybrid by 2020, at around 8 million vehicles,\" said Simon Bryant at analysts Futuresource.  * * *  ## More from CES 2017:  Image copyright L'Oreal Image caption The L'Oreal brush uses acoustic sensors to listen for breaking hair  Follow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017  * * *  But companies like Faraday Future face competition from more established rivals - such as Tesla.  \"Tesla is one of those brands - it has become synonymous with attractive electric vehicles, and the brand keeps innovating,\" Mr Bryant told the BBC.  \"Competing with this will be difficult but the wider electric vehicle industry will benefit from more companies competing in this space.\"", "newsHeadline": "CES 2017: Faraday Future unveils super fast electric car - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38503987", "countriesMentioned": ["United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Uber Volvo](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7F97/production/_90836623_febc7c11 -3a0a-48a6-80cb-a9183743ad15.jpg) Image copyright Volvo Image caption Uber had started to pick up passengers in specially modified Volvo self-driving cars  Uber is applying for a permit to test its self-driving vehicles in California, after it was forced to suspend such trials in December.

It has long been known that Apple is working on automotive-related projects, but the company has never publicly confirmed any details.  The news was made public by California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles on Friday.  The agency said Apple has been given permission to test three cars manufactured by Lexus.  Apple has not commented - other than to point to its letter late last year expressing an interest in the technology.  The company was \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation\u201d, it said at the time.  Rumours about Apple\u2019s car ambitions have ranged from speculation it was building its own car to the suggestion it was instead focusing more on in-car software.  Internally known as Project Titan, the project at one point was understood to have more than 1,000 employees working on it, though the current scale of Apple\u2019s efforts is unknown.  Encountering self-driving cars in California is a daily occurrence for those living around Silicon Valley. Apple has become the 30th company to be granted a testing permit.  Among the stipulations for approval is the requirement to regularly report back statistics on the performance of the technology - including how often humans have to intervene when the computer gets it wrong.  Apple's competitors have already been testing autonomous vehicles. Last year Waymo - a company spun out of Google's self-driving programme - clocked up 635,868 miles in California. Statistics showed a human had to step in on average once every 5,000 miles of driving.  ________  _Follow Dave Lee _on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC  _You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370_", "newsHeadline": "Apple granted self-driving test permit - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39604071", "countriesMentioned": ["United States", "Switzerland", "Belgium", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "There is nothing out here to highlight the scale of these machines. A blue- grey sky hangs behind the enormous structures; the boat we are on, 4 miles (7km) offshore from Liverpool, bobs excitedly up and down on the swell of the sea. We\u2019ve come to the Burbo Bank Extension wind farm to see an engineering marvel: the largest wind turbines in the world.  When one of the turbine\u2019s blades swings to its highest point, it reaches 195m (640ft) \u2013 making these structures nearly twice as tall as Big Ben. The diameter of the turbines\u2019 three colossal blades is greater than that of the London Eye. As the huge wings sail by, cutting the air, they make a gentle swooshing sound.  The very first offshore wind farm was a Danish project. But Britain now leads the world. The largest offshore wind farm on Earth is the UK\u2019s London Array, a massive site of 175 turbines in the outer Thames estuary. Up to 5.2GW of electricity are provided by the country\u2019s offshore turbines \u2013 almost as much as the rest of Europe\u2019s sea-based wind farms put together, with more than two- thirds of continental Europe's capacity. Beyond Europe, the rest of the world\u2019s offshore wind totals just a few gigawatts.  Industry insiders say the significance of tapping the power provided by coastal winds ever more cheaply should not be underestimated. In December 2016, the World Economic Forum reported that as the cost of producing wind turbines has fallen by more than 30% in the last three years, the cost of electricity from wind power has fallen to $50 per megawatt hour on average worldwide, without subsidies. That\u2019s half the cost of coal.  > The cost of electricity from wind power has fallen to $50 per megawatt hour on average worldwide, without subsidies \u2013 half the cost of coal  Even offshore wind, specifically \u2013 which requires especially difficult engineering and rugged structures \u2013 still is cheaper than nuclear power per megawatt hour.  As a result, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and others are investing in wind and countries like China and South Korea are beginning to take an interest, too.  Burbo Bank is a demonstration of just how quickly offshore wind has evolved. The original wind farm, built just 10 years ago, comprised 25 3.6MW turbines \u2013 enough capacity to power about 80,000 homes. The Burbo Bank Extension boasts 32 8MW turbines, providing nearly three times the old farm\u2019s capacity.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference,\u201d says Benj Sykes, vice president and head of asset management at the Danish firm Dong Energy, which installed the Burbo Bank Extension. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s testament to the progress in technology over the last 10 years.\u201d  A single rotation of one of those giant blades, he says, could power an average British home for 29 hours. Spinning at their fastest, the blades rotate nearly 30 times per minute. But there are limits to how much force these giant rotors can harness. If spun too fast, the motion could damage the turbine, so the blades are designed to lock in place when a gale picks up.  But turbines need to be maintained once they are constructed. As they are far from shore, that can be difficult. In Liverpool, teams of shift technicians tend to the lonely structures of Burbo Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact same thing you do to your car,\u201d says supervisor Justin Monaghan. \u201cWhen it breaks down, you go in and find out what is wrong.\u201d  Depending on the problem, Monaghan and his team might fix or replace electrical gear, hydraulics or moving parts. Each structure has its own barrel of food and water inside just in case the weather changes suddenly and a technician has to wait it out.  How do you install an offshore turbine?  You can\u2019t build on water. But you can drive long piles down into the seabed to provide a foundation.  The depths at which this is done vary greatly \u2013 the deepest in Europe being around 40m. There are plans to develop floating offshore wind farms at even greater depths, though, with one such project recently given planning permission in Aberdeen.  Once a foundational pile is in place, however, a \u2018transitional piece\u2019 that brings the structure above sea level is added.  Finally, the turbine itself, and each of the three blades, is winched into place.  Right now, that\u2019s an extremely rare occurrence thanks to detailed forecasts and careful monitoring of the weather while workers are out on the turbines. But living on site at an offshore wind farm may soon be part of the job. The next landmark project for the offshore wind industry is Hornsea, off the north-west coast of England. The site itself will be far from shore: 120km away. Instead of being ferried back and forth, up to 150 technicians will live in offshore accommodation, not unlike those who work on oil platforms.  When completed in 2021, phase one of Hornsea\u2019s construction alone will make it the largest offshore wind farm in the world with a capacity of up to 1.2GW. Depending on planning for the final stages, the entire farm could have 4-6GW of capacity when completed in the mid-2020s \u2013 enough to power more than four million homes, or roughly 15% of all the homes in the UK.  **Far out**  Even more remote projects are already being brainstormed by developers. There is a proposal to build an artificial island in the middle of the North Sea with hundreds of turbines encircling it. Power lines to the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Great Britain could divide the electricity between them. Capacity estimates vary, but some range from 70-100GW \u2013 more than all of the nuclear power stations in France put together.  A wind farm like that would take decades to plan and construct, however, and for now it remains a relatively distant prospect.  Instead, most expect the UK to continue its investment in offshore wind simply by building up wind farms on a similar scale to those already in existence. \u201cThere is huge potential,\u201d says Joel Meggelaars of trade body Wind Europe. \u201cThe UK and the North Sea is a very windy region.\u201d Meggelaars explains that the load factor of British turbines \u2013 the amount of energy actually produced \u2013 is unusually high. In December last year, offshore turbines in the UK clocked an average load of 68.2% of total capacity. For many offshore farms elsewhere, the figure is often less than 50%.  The bigger turbines get, the better the power output. While 8MW may be the current maximum, Meggelaars expects this to roughly double in 10 years.  Turbines can stand in remote spots for as much as 25 years with ongoing maintenance. Unlike solar energy, of course, they also provide power during the night \u2013 so long as it\u2019s windy.  There are downsides to offshore wind, however. As well as being costly to install and maintain, the turbines may have a detrimental impact on wildlife. Critics say that they are particularly disruptive to colonies of birds like gannets and kittiwakes, and a proposed extension to London Array was blocked in court due to the threat posed to seabirds.  Others say the vibrations of the turbines could disorient whales. However, beyond the noise of installing the piles that the turbines are placed on \u2013 which is very loud \u2013 it is not known how harmful sound generated by the normal operation of the machines may be.  > One poll found that 73% of the public supported offshore wind farms  But many in Britain already have their sights set on a future increasingly powered by offshore wind. There\u2019s more public enthusiasm than land-based farms, too. Despite some complaints that they tarnish sea views, there is evidence that a majority of people are in favour of them. One poll in 2016 found that 73% of the public supported offshore wind farms.  \u201cThey\u2019re a bit less obtrusive when they\u2019re offshore, they\u2019re a bit further away,\u201d points out Monaghan. \u201cThey\u2019re not in the back of your garden whizzing away.\u201d  For now, Britain\u2019s turbines seem to satisfy many of the requirements we have of renewable energy. They\u2019re clean, they don\u2019t get in the way of ordinary people, and they give a boost to local industry. The long-term advantages and disadvantages may soon become clearer. But for now, the new blades at Burbo Bank spin on, the power they generate flowing into the grid.  _This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

Yet it\u2019s an unfortunate reality that engineers and planners must make tough decisions before expanding a transport network. Figuring out what important buildings, archaeological artefacts and cultural heritage to save, what to excavate and what to demolish can be complex \u2013 and fraught with controversy.  These dilemmas have been brought into sharp focus by two of the UK\u2019s ongoing transport megaprojects: Crossrail, a giant tunnel network beneath London, and HS2, which will link the capital to northern England by high-speed rail.  In a few years\u2019 time, passengers will ride these networks oblivious to the destruction that was required to build them. But as BBC Britain discovered, there are a few silver linings, too: these projects have unearthed intriguing archaeological finds that may not have emerged otherwise.  _See our video on the archaeological finds unearthed by Crossrail below:_  Crossrail, which is wrapping up its building phase now, is currently the largest construction scheme in Europe. The 73-mile (118km) line runs through the heart of London. That location doesn\u2019t just entail grappling with the logistical issues provided by a densely-packed urban environment \u2013 like how to build around the infrastructure and transport links already in place. (In one particularly tricky section at Tottenham Court Road, for example, Crossrail was tunnelled between the London Underground\u2019s Northern line and station\u2026 leaving just 31in [80cm] of padding on either side). It also means dealing with more than 2,000 years\u2019 worth of artefacts, buildings, even human burials.  Re-routing to avoid a much-loved building or archaeological site can be all but impossible. As Crossrail\u2019s head archaeologist Jay Carver puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s got to go from A to B, via the right places. It\u2019s no good having a station out of town where no one can get to it.\u201d Speed, of course, is another issue. A high-speed railway won\u2019t work with a line that curves and wiggles all over the map.  **Dig deep**  While the Crossrail line runs deeper than the archaeological layer, the entrance shafts and stations do not. And moving a station slightly further north or west to avoid one site often would mean affecting another.  One example was Crossrail\u2019s Tottenham Court Road ticket hall in the West End of London, which had an added challenge: as a station interchange which had to link the Northern line and Crossrail underground, it had little scope to move. As a result, Crossrail demolished some buildings for the interchange \u2013 including the much-loved Astoria Theatre, a cinema-turned-concert-venue built in 1927 that hosted headliners including Oasis, Nirvana and U2.  The Astoria wasn\u2019t a listed building, which made it more vulnerable. Still, Carver notes, \u201cfor most sites \u2013 even for sites which are scheduled or protected by UK law, such as a scheduled monument or a listed building \u2013 there is always an opportunity to apply for the demolition of that asset. There\u2019s a legal process you can go through... If you can justify the public good outweighs the heritage significance, whereas it has to be quite a strict weighting, then you can demolish a protected asset.\u201d One protected building Crossrail demolished was the Grade II-listed 96 Dean Street; like the rest, it first was investigated archaeologically and any outstanding architectural pieces, like staircases, went to a national art collection.  For historic buildings which weren\u2019t demolished, there were still concerns. Chief among them was whether vibrations from Crossrail\u2019s 1,000-tonne, 495ft (150m) long tunnel boring machines (TBMs) might cause damage.  Delicate buildings were fitted with sensors to detect tiny movements, feeding information of any shaking back to a control room. \u201cHundreds of buildings were monitored like they were in intensive care,\u201d says Carver. The sensors didn\u2019t turn up any trouble, although at one house \u2013 Soho\u2019s Georgian-era St Barnabas House \u2013 workers removed a statue standing in the foyer during tunnelling, just in case.  The parting memento the company is giving to engineers shows just how integral that process became: the gift includes one of the now-retired sensors.  As Crossrail, due to open in 2019, finishes up, eyes are turning to HS2, which will connect London to Birmingham in its first phase.  Since much of the line runs through rural England, demolishing or damaging buildings is less of an issue (though critics have objected to the risks to the rural landscape as well as potential noise). But the sheer length of the line \u2013 whose 140-mile (225km) section from London to Birmingham is less than half of the entire Y-shaped route \u2013 still encounters a myriad of important, and delicate, sites, ranging from 19th-Century burial grounds to Iron Age earthworks.  Perhaps surprisingly, in some ways HS2 is at a disadvantage compared to Crossrail. When determining which sites might be affected by this kind of project, the first step is an intensive review of maps and documentation \u2013 records of which London, of course, has plenty. Even though that review was then followed by on-the-ground investigations, like drilling boreholes to extract archaeological layers or digging test pits, the amount of information archaeologists already know about London means \u201cyou\u2019re not really going to find a surprise in terms of what you find where\u201d, says Carver.  > We do as much as possible before we even need to put a spade in the ground \u2013 Helen Glass  Much of the land around HS2, though, isn\u2019t developed and hasn\u2019t been investigated. So HS2\u2019s archaeologists are taking a different approach.  \u201cWe\u2019ve done geophysical surveys, aerial photography, Lidar [remote sensing using light],\u201d says Helen Glass, HS2\u2019s head archaeologist. \u201cWe do as much as possible before we even need to put a spade in the ground.  \u201c[But] there are still always, as a detailed design progresses, gaps in knowledge to be filled in \u2013 because obviously, before we\u2019ve got permission to build the railroad, we can\u2019t excavate from London to Birmingham \u2018just in case\u2019.\u201d  In rare cases, more information has led planners to change the route. An early scheme for HS2 had the line cutting close to a yet-unexcavated ancient Roman villa, for example, and through the location of the Battle of Edgcote \u2013 one of the bloodiest battles of the Wars of Roses and the possible home to a mass grave. It also went through the grounds of the Georgian Edgcote House, used as a setting in the 1995 television series of Pride and Prejudice. (Though the building is Grade I-listed, its gardens and grounds are not).  After input from groups like Battlefields Trust and Historic England and finding that the Roman villa was larger than it previously seemed, HS2\u2019s route was moved further from Edgcote\u2019s sites. The proposed line still clips the battlefield\u2019s north-east corner, says Simon Marsh, the research and threats coordinator of Battlefields Trust: \u201cThis seems to be considered one of those wholly exceptional situations on the basis that putting curves into high-speed rail prevents it being high-speed.\u201d But, he notes, archaeological work should be done before the line is built \u2013 so there will be an opportunity to test for any artefacts first.  A more intractable challenge has been Grim\u2019s Ditch in Buckinghamshire. Thought to date back nearly 3,000 years, it remains unclear if the ditch is a territory boundary or something else, not least of all because the ditch has never been excavated before. Because of its 18km length, \u201cthere\u2019s no choice really but to cut across it\u201d, says Andy Brown, the planning director for Historic England in the South East. \u201cRather than trying to fight that \u2013 because cutting across a long monument doesn\u2019t do it grievous harm; it\u2019s harmful, but not grievous \u2013 it\u2019s about seizing the opportunity to understand it how it was built, when it was built.\u201d  The Grim\u2019s Ditch excavation points to the potential upside of what happens when projects cut through archaeological sites. Excavation is an inherently destructive process. But of course it is one that can provide clues to an area\u2019s history, people and culture. As the Museum of London exhibition Tunnel: The Archaeology of Crossrail shows, Crossrail uncovered everything from Tudor- era bowling balls to skulls found, mysteriously, without their skeletons.  Now, Crossrail is passing the mantle of major archaeological investigation (and even its archaeologists: Carver soon is moving from Crossrail to HS2). \u201cThis will be the biggest archaeological investigation programme in the UK, bar none,\u201d Glass says of HS2.  > We\u2019re trying to marry what is a very academic discipline with actually delivering a railway \u2013 Helen Glass  Some of the investigations that could be especially informative also are the most controversial \u2013 like the excavations of St James\u2019 Gardens, a cemetery used in the 18th and 19th Centuries in London, or the abandoned cemetery of Stoke Mandeville, which may have been used for 700 years. But as Crossrail demonstrated with the skeletons of plague victims found at both Charterhouse Square and Liverpool Street, by using both osteological techniques and modern DNA analysis on the exhumed skeletons, there is the opportunity to understand more about everything from how diets changed to family relationships. Human remains are \u201calways one of the hardest archaeological sites to see disturbed\u201d says Jim Williams, senior science advisor for the East Midlands at Historic England. \u201cWhen we do disturb them, I think it\u2019s important to make the most of that opportunity.\u201d  Glass agrees. Her team is going into excavations with specific questions to ask in advance \u2013 just as academic researchers would.  \u201cOur research and delivery strategy is, rather than just gathering data, focusing on specific questions,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to marry what is a very academic discipline with actually delivering a railway.\u201d  _This story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

The 9.2 trillion won ($7.2bn; \u00a35.8bn) quarterly profit is the South Korean firm's highest since 2013.  In October, the smartphone maker had to scrap the Note 7, after recalling 2.5 million handsets. Batteries were blamed for phones catching fire.  Samsung has also been embroiled in a corruption scandal, threatening its reputation, so how has it done so well?  ## It's not just about phones  Recalling and then ultimately killing off the Note 7, is thought to have cost Samsung $5.3bn (\u00a34.3bn), a sum that would have made the firm's profits far bigger.  But while it is the world's biggest smartphone maker, phones are not its only business. It is also well known for its flat screen televisions and that side of things is doing well.  But the real jewel in the crown has been its semiconductor business which makes the chips for phones and servers.  Memory chip prices are rising sharply as demand grows, primarily from phone makers and Samsung is the biggest maker of the chips, ahead of rivals like Toshiba.  ## Customers seem unfazed  Despite the YouTube videos of burning phones, the drip-drip of negative stories and the internet memes, Samsung does not seem to have been as tarnished anywhere near as badly as you might expect.  A Reuters/IPOS study in the aftermath of the scandal found Samsung users in the US remained as loyal to their brand as Apple users were to their iPhones.  Because the problem was identified shortly after the Note 7 was released the recall was mostly limited to early adopters, and this limited the negative experiences, said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.  Image copyright Brian Green Image caption This Samsung phone led to a flight being evacuated - but the Samsung image is not too tarnished.  \"Your own personal experience trumps what you read and what people tell you,\" Dawson at the time of the Reuters/Ipsos poll.  And Samsung has said that after its recall, most customers chose to replace their Note 7 with a different Samsung handset - including the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge - rather than getting the money back.  Our correspondents in South Korea say that a major corporate scandal - which led to a court being asked to issue an arrest warrant for the firm's heir apparent over bribery allegations \\- did not seem to have tarnished the corporation's reputation at home dramatically either.  However, while the arrest request was turned down, Samsung remains embroiled in the case and the firm has acknowledged the \"changing political landscape in Korea\" could have some longer term impact on the business. So future results will be watched closely.  ## Currency benefit  Not a particularly glamorous explanation but the strong dollar has also been a benefit to Samsung.  The won's value against the US currency has fallen, meaning that when sales from overseas are brought back to South Korea they are worth more.  It's something all South Korean exporters have benefited from recently.

South Korea's special prosecutor's office announced the charges against the de-facto Samsung chief, along with four other company executives.  Three of those executives resigned on Tuesday following the announcement.  Samsung also said it was dismantling its corporate strategic office, a unit coordinating the various arms of the huge conglomerate.  Samsung is accused of giving donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Ms Park, in exchange for government favours.  He had been arrested earlier this month as prosecutors prepared the indictment.  ## What's the accusation?  Prosecutors accused Mr Lee of giving donations worth 41bn won ($36m; \u00a329m) to organisations linked to Ms Choi. They alleged this was done to win government support for a big restructuring of Samsung that would help a smooth leadership transition in favour of Mr Lee, who is standing in as chairman for his ill father, Lee Kun-hee.  The controversial merger required support from the national pension fund \\- the allegation is that this support was granted in return for the donations.  In a December parliamentary hearing, Samsung admitted giving a total of 20.4bn won to two foundations, but denied seeking favours in return.  Mr Lee also confirmed the firm gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Ms Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, something he said he now regrets.  ## What's the political scandal?  This centres around President Park's ties to Ms Choi and has brought allegations of cult activities, influence-peddling and leaks of classified information.  Ms Choi is a long term family friend whose father had already had close ties with President Park's father who was president in the 1970s.  Image copyright AP Image caption The scandal is centred on the close relationship between Ms Park and Ms Choi  As well as soliciting donations, Ms Choi is accused of using their friendship to interfere in politics.  She is now on trial charged with various offences, including abuse of authority, coercion and attempted fraud, and denies wrongdoing.  Parliament voted in December to impeach President Park. Her case is now being heard by the constitutional court. Meanwhile she has been stripped of her presidential powers.  A friendship too far in Seoul?  ## What does it mean for Samsung?  Mr Lee is currently vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics. But since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014, he is considered de facto boss of the entire Samsung Group conglomerate.  Regardless of the outcome, a trial is a big blow to the company. His arrest may not affect short term production or the running of the firm but there could be long term implications.  ##  Lee Jae-yong  ###  Samsung's heir apparent    * \\- Grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul, son of current chairman Lee Kun-hee.     * \\- Also known as Jay Y Lee, the 48-year-old has spent his entire career in the company.     * \\- Is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and was nominated to join the firm's board in October 2016.     * \\- Despite his arrest, still widely expected to take overall control of Samsung.     * \\- Critics say his rise through Samsung has been due to his birth, not his business experience.

Even in normal circumstances, the stakes are high when a phone maker unveils its latest flagship handset. But the past few months have been anything but normal for Samsung.  And at the simultaneous release of the S8 in London and New York, the elephant in the room is a big one.  This is the launch that follows the Note 7 scandal last year, the phone Samsung recalled and then eventually scrapped after some batteries overheated and caught fire.  \"With this launch, Samsung gets a chance to redeem itself after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco...but it may be too early to say that Samsung's troubles are behind it now,\" says Kiranjeet Kaur of tech analysts IDC.  ## How much damage has been done?  While the Galaxy S models are the company's flagship line and widely seen as the only serious competitor to Apple's iPhone, the Note models are a range of large-screen phablets, aimed only at a niche market.  So did the global headlines of Note phones going up in flames burn the Samsung image?  Image copyright AP Image caption Samsung has said its Note 7 recall has cost it millions of dollars  Anecdotally the brand still seems in good shape.  Despite the YouTube videos of burning phones, the drip-drip of negative stories and the internet memes, Samsung does not seem to have been as tarnished anywhere near as badly as you might expect.  A Reuters/IPSOS study in the aftermath of the scandal found Samsung users in the US remained as loyal to their brand as Apple users were to their iPhones.  Because the problem was identified shortly after the Note 7 was released the recall was mostly limited to early adopters, and this limited the negative experiences, said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.  \"Your own personal experience trumps what you read and what people tell you,\" Dawson said at the time of the Reuters/Ipsos poll.  Yet recalling, and then ultimately killing off, the Note 7, is thought to have cost Samsung $5.3bn (\u00a34.3bn).  ## So, are they struggling financially?  No. Samsung Electronics saw profits surge 50% in the last three months of 2016, despite the Note 7 phone fiasco.  And the firm's share price has climbed steadily over the past 12 months.  Image caption Despite a difficult year, Samsung's shares have climbed and climbed  That resilience is largely because the Galaxy S7 - the precursor to the new phone launched this Wednesday - has been a real success.  And it is even more remarkable given Samsung is also embroiled in South Korea's political corruption scandal - with the firm accused of having bribed the government in return for political favours - something it strenuously denies.  Samsung heir apparent and de facto boss Lee Jae-yong has been arrested and is on trial accused of bribery and corruption. He also has maintained his innocence.  While this scandal has sent shockwaves though South Korea and the country's corporate world, there is no evidence it has impacted the decision of consumers around the world when it comes to choosing their next smartphone.  ## What's the competition?  For the past several years, Samsung's has been caught in the middle, competing with both Apple's premium iPhone on the one hand, and cheaper Chinese smartphones on the other.  Neither of these have gone away. The iPhone 7 continues to be a top seller for Apple, with the US company now even offering cheaper options - the older iPhone 6s and the scaled down iPhone SE - that still benefit from the premium brand image but are more affordable.  These factors saw Apple overtake Samsung in smartphone shipments for the first time in the last three months of 2016.  The IDC data showed Apple had 18.3% market share compared with Samsung's 18.1%.  From the side of Chinese competition, the likes of Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi are continuing to offer Android phones that regularly get top reviews but tend to be much cheaper than whatever Samsung has to offer with comparable specifications.  Image copyright Huawei Image caption The likes of Huawei are ready to take a big bite out of Samsung's market dominance  So for a long time, Samsung's lower and mid-tier offerings have been able to benefit from Samsung's reputation of very good quality phones - distinguishing them from that \"cheaper upstart\" image of the Chinese competition.  In that respect, brand image was crucial for Samsung and many of its phones feed off the reputation of the flagship.  But it is worth noting Huawei, Oppo and another Chinese brand Vivo are now the third, fourth and fifth best-selling handsets respectively - with Oppo and Vivo each recording more than 100% year on-year growth in 2016, though admittedly from a low base.  ## Smartphone fatigue?  New smartphones tend to have incremental updates. Innovation is rarely distinctive enough to really stand out from whatever the previous model had to offer.  And that means all smartphone makers face the growing problem of handset fatigue.  Even Apple's latest iPhone has been criticised as \"more of the same\", with improved details but lacking enough new features to wow the average consumer.  Samsung faces the same tough problem.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption How to stand out from the competition?  The attention will be on three hardware elements: the camera, the display and the battery.  We can safely assume that the camera will be better, possibly trying to edge out the iPhone's snapper with some added 3D features.  The display is expected to be bigger with a smaller bezel so that there might be more screen packed into the same overall size of the phone.  As for the battery, it is safe to assume that after the Note 7 issues, Samsung will have pushed its engineers more towards battery safety than capacity this time round.  In terms of software, analysts are also expecting a range of changes, with the new Bixby virtual assistant being just one of them.  ## Make it or break it?  Samsung's Galaxy S8 might well be a make it or break it moment for the company.  If it does everything right, there is a good chance they can hold on to the crown of the Android market and the Note 7 will go down as a one-off flop.  Yet should anything at all go wrong, things might turn out differently. Trust tends to be a lot easier to lose than to regain.  The close scrutiny that Samsung's new phone will be facing in the coming weeks and months, means even small glitches risk being magnified.  Jake Saunders, vice president of tech research firm ABI says there is little doubt that Samsung will have had its engineers working around the clock to make sure that the new phone is absolutely foolproof - but there will still be nerves.  \"Samsung may be hoping for a smooth, glitch-free launch to restore consumer confidence in the brand, but it could be a long, hot summer.\"\u200e", "newsHeadline": "Samsung: Is Galaxy S8 the firm's most important phone yet? - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39418774", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa", "South Korea"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Greenpeace protester on Samsung stage at Mobile World Congress](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C0A1/production/_95331394_gettyimages-645597274.jpg) Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Greenpeace crashed a Samsung presentation earlier this year calling on it to reuse Galaxy Note 7 parts  Samsung is releasing a new phone using parts from its Galaxy Note 7, which was axed after a battery fault led to some devices catching fire.

It led to US sanctions on a group of Russian officials, retaliation by Russia and the bizarre spectacle of a dead man being put on trial.  That man, the late lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, was found guilty of tax fraud by a Moscow court on 11 July 2013, as was his former boss, US-born investment fund manager Bill Browder. Mr Magnitsky died in prison in 2009 - allegedly after beatings - but Russia dropped an investigation into his death.  **Who was Sergei Magnitsky?**  Mr Magnitsky was an auditor at a Moscow law firm when he discovered what he said was a massive fraud by Russian tax officials and police officers.  He uncovered the alleged theft of $230m (\u00a3150m). After reporting it to the authorities, he was himself detained in 2008 on suspicion of aiding tax evasion, and died in custody on 16 November 2009 at the age of 37.  He acted as a legal adviser for London-based Hermitage Capital Management (HCM), where colleagues insist the case against him was fabricated to make him halt his investigations.  Despite his death Russian prosecutors decided to put him on trial - a case dismissed as a \"circus\" by his family and by HCM founder Bill Browder, who was himself tried in absentia. Mr Browder is now a British citizen, based in London.  **How did he die? **  Mr Magnitsky is said to have died of acute heart failure and toxic shock, caused by untreated pancreatitis.  An investigation by Russia's Presidential Human Rights Council also found that he had been severely beaten - an allegation made by his family too.  Mr Browder has alleged that Mr Magnitsky was subjected to torture and beatings in prison.  **Did Russia investigate?**  An official investigation by the Russian authorities was ordered in November 2009 by the then President Dmitry Medvedev, and several prison officials, including the deputy head of the Russian federal prison administration (FSIN), were fired over his death in December 2009. Initially, the officials said his death was caused by cramped conditions and failure to provide adequate healthcare.  In June 2010, the Russian Interior Ministry started an investigation into the improper imprisonment of Mr Magnitsky, but they did not name any suspects.  In 2011 one prison doctor was charged with involuntary manslaughter, but the charges were later dropped. Another doctor was charged with medical negligence, but later acquitted. No other suspects have been named.  In its July 2011 report, the Human Rights Council pointed to a conflict of interest in the case, as some of those investigating Mr Magnitsky were the very same people he had accused of massive corruption.  But on 19 March 2013 the Investigative Committee - Russia's version of the FBI in the US - dropped the investigation, saying Mr Magnitsky had been legally arrested and detained, and that he had not been tortured.  **How did this start?**  Bill Browder and his investment fund HCM was one of the largest private equity firms investing in Russia before the scandal broke.  In 2005, after he exposed the details of an enormous corruption scheme involving many high-ranking Russian officials, Mr Browder's visa to Russia was cancelled and he was deported from Russia, deemed to be a national threat. Despite his ban, he kept investigating corruption in Russia, working closely with Mr Magnitsky.  As part of his work for HCM, Mr Magnitsky discovered how some Russian companies were registered to new owners and, while money was changing hands, large rebates and VAT claims were allegedly laundered through Russian banks and appropriated by a group of tax and police officials.  His death prompted the compilation by human rights activists and HCM of the so-called Magnitsky list of some 60 officials - including some from the interior ministry, police, and tax authorities - who Magnitsky alleged were involved in the crime. The full list of names has never been released.  **How does the US come into it?**  Sergei Magnitsky's death had wide public resonance, not only in Russia, but also in the West. His case became a symbol of the fight against corruption in Russia.  In December 2012 the US Congress adopted the Magnitsky Act. It enables the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations.  The act replaced the outdated Jackson-Vanik amendment, introduced in 1974, which tied trade relations with the former Soviet Union to the emigration of Jews and other Soviet minorities, and which included a number of restrictions for Russian exporters.  **How did Russia respond?**  Just days after the US act was passed Russia retaliated by barring Americans from adopting Russian orphans.  The adoption ban was part of a tit-for-tat law which also blacklisted US citizens considered by Russia to have violated human rights.  Another clause suspended the activities of non-profit organisations that receive cash and other assets from the US and that engage in political activities in Russia. There are concerns that this will hit some human rights campaigners in Russia.", "newsHeadline": "Q&A: The Magnitsky affair - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20626960", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "United Kingdom", "Russia", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "# Stunning composite images show an armada of airliners  By Stephen Dowling 28 October 2016  Thousands of airliners take off and land every day.

Stand on the bridge of a container ship docked in a mega-port in Korea, however, and it's clear that's just not true. The global supply chain that brings us those tablets and phones, and pretty much everything else from our clothes and food to our toys and souvenirs, is nothing short of a moon shot itself \u2013 a vast, unprecedented engineering solution to a truly astronomical logistics problem. The fact that it's hidden from most people's sight, and that it has become so utterly reliable and efficient to the point of transparency, doesn't make it any less of an achievement of human technical endeavour.  To find out more about this huge, invisible network, I accompanied a group of architects and designers called the Unknown Fields Division for a rare voyage on a container ship between Korea and China. The aim of the trip was to follow the supply chain back to some of the remotest parts of China and the source of our consumer goods \u2013 and what we saw as we travelled through mega-ports and across oceans looked closer to science fiction than reality.  **Early rise**  We're picked up at 9am from our guesthouse in the Korean city of Busan by a local 'ground agent' for the shipping company Maersk, whose ship will be carrying us for the next week. They have at least one of these personnel handlers in every major port in the world, their job being to ensure crew members make their way through each country's unique and complex maze of customs and immigration bureaucracy, and on to their ships on time.  If you were asked to name some multi-national corporate brands you could probably reel off half a dozen, from Apple to Coca-Cola, but chances are that Maersk wouldn't spring to mind. Yet the Danish shipping giant is the very definition of a multi-national corporation, with over 25,000 employees, 345 offices in 125 countries, 600 active ships, and more than 2 million containers moved every year. The company is estimated to be responsible for 20% of Denmark's GDP on its own. Maersk might not make any of the things you buy in shops, but it more than likely put a lot of them there.  As we drive along, Busan's dense mass of high-rise apartment blocks gives way to what will be one of the defining images of the next seven days; the giant cranes that line every major port in the world. Soon we're into the depths of Busan New Port itself, and speeding past endless, towering stacks of shipping containers until we're finally dwarfed by the huge, blue mass of the Maersk Seletar, the 320m- (1,050ft-) long, 80,000 tonne, 9,000 container capacity ship that will be my home for the next seven days.  It's not until we get out on to the towering balconies around the ship's bridge and look back at Busan that we're fully able to first comprehend the scale and nature of these Asian mega-ports. It feels like we're being given a rare look into a usually hidden space, a peek at the intricate but city-scaled machinery of global capitalism.  From that viewpoint \u2013 essentially high above the sea, looking into land \u2013 it's easiest to describe the ports as a sequence of layers. First, towering above and over the ship, are the loading cranes. Vast structures mounted on huge, four-legged frames, they resemble the naked scaffolding of unbuilt skyscrapers, and trigger nostalgic reminders of Saturn V rocket launch towers from the 1960s. Their sheer size makes them the first thing you see when you arrive at any port \u2013 whether from land or sea, and as staggering as they are they don't make their full impact until you see them move.  **Future gaze**  Built on tracks in the surface of the harbour-side, they slide left and right, parallel to the berthed ships, accompanied by a cacophony of warning sounds and robotic safety announcements. Once in port at night I saw one suddenly fire into life next to the ship in a stroboscopic explosion of lights, before it tracked slowly above my high vantage point, bathing me in the orange glow of a dozen small halogen suns. It was an intense experience.  The second layer in from the cranes are the trucks; a constant loop of circling, diesel-belching flatbeds. Endlessly, they arrive at the bottom of the vast cranes, seemingly one every minute when the port is at its busiest, stopping in precise locations so the crane drivers can either pluck their containers off their backs and on to the ships, or drop a freshly unloaded container straight on to them, before the trucks instantly pull away and head inland.  It's a hypnotic, fascinating dance to watch: the cranes lifting containers off the ships, the trucks pulling up in time to catch them as they are elegantly lowered down on steel cables. The complex and precise orchestration behind every move is almost bewildering to comprehend. The ships never unload everything at just one port \u2013 that'd be hugely inefficient for these vast, globe-orbiting warehouses \u2013 so the crane drivers need to know which one to take off and when, just as the truck drivers need to know where to take each one they collect.  It's the kind of logistical information that it's hard to imagine any one human mind comprehending, and the truth is no single one does \u2013 this is distributed knowledge, managed by Maersk's vast world-spanning computer network and shaped and interpreted by complex, similarly unknowable, algorithms. In a very real sense the crane and truck drivers are little more than elements in a vast robotic system, receiving instructions in their cabs from their computerised managers, following orders on endless cycles until their shift ends.  Not that there isn't a certain amount of pride in their work, as regimented and alienating as it might seem \u2013 it's not unusual to see the cranes decorated with awards and badges announcing record breaking container shifting performances. At the same time it's also impossible not to be struck by the precariousness of their job security; with so much managed by the network it must surely only be a matter of time before the system evolves enough to remove the human element entirely. In fact, ports like Rotterdam in the Netherlands have already moved to fully automated systems, with driverless trucks and robotic cranes.  **Stacked neighbours**  Layer three, sat behind the cranes and trucks, is the most easily recognisable image from the whole process: the container stacks. From the bridge of the Seletar they look like row upon row of repeating, multicoloured Lego bricks, six units high, each straddled by multiple cranes \u2013 miniature versions of the ship loaders, sliding back and forth on rails. These cranes continually shuffle the position of the containers within the stacks themselves, following the algorithmic wisdom of the network to ensure everything is in the most efficient position possible; cargo heading backwards and forwards, inland and out.  At every port we arrived at, the three layers \u2013 cranes, trucks, containers \u2013 seemed fundamentally the same, standardised with only the occasional exception. The Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung uses small, fast moving, mini cranes instead of trucks \u2013 oddly top-heavy looking skeletal machines that bounce along on huge moon-buggy tyres. They swarm endlessly like busy robots, their blue or yellow frames smeared in grease and grime, discharging black clouds of diesel smog.  It's only layer four that displays any individualisation \u2013 the landscapes beyond the ports. In Busan it was housing blocks branded with corporation logos nestling beneath green mountains. And at Shanghai's Yangshan Deep Water Port it was the six-lane, 20 mile long Donghai bridge, built to carry the constant flow of container trucks in and out from the port, built on a vast artificial island.  **Dark skies**  After three days at sea, we reach the city of Ningbo. Arriving into port at night we are presented with an almost nightmare vision, a Blade Runner-like landscape of glowing lights and smokestacks painting the low cloud ceiling orange. We'd been delayed going in as the black shadow of a ship owned by French giant CMA CGM slid gently past. It towers above ours, with a startling 18,000 container capacity. As soon as we hit port-side the cranes fired into life, the trucks queuing up as though impatient to make up the delayed time.  The next morning, unable to sleep, I rise at 4.30am and head for the top of the ship again, eager to see the port in daylight. The industrial landscape in front of me is vast and awful: a huge coal burning power station fed directly by incoming bulk carrier ships sits right on the port-side, its towers filling the sky with black, while the landscape behind is filled with refineries, gas storage plants, and tightly huddled together housing blocks. You can not only see the pollution \u2013 the vast carbon footprint of this industrial network \u2013 but taste it in the air. As much talk and concern as there is in the West about the environmental impact of China's economic dominance, it's easy to forget how much of that impact the Chinese people are taking as a direct hit themselves, as much for the West\u2019s benefit as their own.  It's not just onshore environments that containerisation has shaped and transformed. The surfaces of our planet's oceans \u2013 for centuries a space of mystery and myth, of expanse and desolation \u2013 have been rationalised and shrunk. Once an enigmatic, awe-inspiring place, the sea has become a zone of efficiency, little more than another channel for the automated supply chain network.  Over the course of seven days there wasn't a single time when I stood on the bridge of the Seletar, even when deep at sea, that I couldn't look out and see other container ships, and a brief scan of the horizon with binoculars would usually reveal four or five more. The implications are even more startling when nearing a port, and seeing dozens of vast ships held at anchorage, lined up like trucks in a parking lot. The sea has become dominated by GPS tracking and autopiloted navigation, where the shipping routes are more than just vague geographical gestures, but instead precise spaces traced out both by computerised charts and physical markers, with deep sea buoys marking lanes like the painted lines on road surfaces.  **Human shift**  Change the sea and change ships and it's impossible to not also change seafarers, although perhaps the impact containerisation has had on ship crews is a little more subtle. Certainly, like the crane and truck drivers back at the port, there's a certain sense of alienation from the cargo. Nobody on the ship knows what lies inside the containers the ship carries.  There are exceptions of course; hazardous materials must be declared, as must the contents of the refrigerated containers \u2013 known in the industry as reefers. The reefers themselves are fascinating pieces of technology, basic containers outfitted to be advanced climate controlled, computer monitored micro-environments. Checking the reefers are running is the crew\u2019s only tangible, direct responsibility for the cargo beyond ensuring it arrives on time. Even so, it is still highly computer-controlled; the ship\u2019s captain, Brian Argent, tells me that the crew's emails piggy-back off a satellite uplink designed keep an eye on the reefers, transmitting status updates thousands of miles back to land so that the company's computers know about a problem before the ship's crew does.  And that's not all the ship receives emails about: Maersk regularly sends Argent and his senior officers messages informing him of course changes or of what speed to take. Even the captain has become just another node in the network, the running of his ship dictated by the unseen algorithms.  The myth of the seafarer as the drunken adventurer with \u201ca girl in every port\u201d couldn't be further from the truth, with shore leave a rarity, and ports so far from urban centres that day leave excursions become little more than trips to out-of-town shopping malls to stock up on essentials such as shampoo, shower gel, and snacks. But for most of the Seletar's crew \u2013 made up of mainly Indian, Filipino, and Chinese seafarers \u2013 the reasons for going to sea are the same as they ever were: \u00a0to make money that can be sent home to their wives, children, and parents.  And even the sense of distance from their families shrunk, thanks to the Seletar\u2019s satellite internet access. It's slow and patchy, but it's enough for the crew to maintain daily communication with home \u2013 with most of them spending a sizable chunk of their free time crouching in corridors and stairwells with smartphones and laptops, trying to find the elusive wi-fi signal so they can talk to home, send messages to loved ones, and connect to Facebook.  It's a fascinating sight at first, and within a few days I find myself doing the exact same thing. I'd initially thought it might be fun \u2013 healthy even \u2013 to truly escape the internet and life back home for a few days. That was before I realised what the Seletar really was, saw how it was just another node in the network, another rationalised point in the global infrastructure, a bridge between the physical and digital. Once I saw that, I knew it was time to abandon my romantic notions of being away at sea, that it was pointless to resist the lure of the network, and found myself squatting in the stairwell between Decks C and D, trying to get reconnected.  _Share this story on __Facebook__, __Google+__ or __Twitter__._  Read the first instalment in this series, where Tim Maughan and the Unknown Fields group visits the Chinese city of Yiwu, the real home of Christmas.

Yet after decades of research and billions of dollars in investment, intercepting an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile, or \u201chitting a bullet with another bullet\u201d, as it\u2019s often described, still cannot be done reliably.  In a test last month, for instance, a US ground-based interceptor failed to take down a missile, marking another defeat for a system that has had, to date, a mixed record at best.  Ironically, that ground-based missile defense system, which uses a so-called \u201chit to kill\u201d approach, where the amount of destructive energy released on impact disables or destroys the intercepted missile, is less ambitious and seemingly more practical than missile defense schemes of years past. Previous attempts often involved exotic directed-energy weapons and Death Star-like complexity. What follows is a partial list of the most outlandish ideas:  **Excalibur (Cancelled 1992)**   It was perhaps the grandest missile defense scheme of all time: A space-based nuclear-pumped X-ray laser that would blast large numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The cornerstone of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Strategic Defense Initiative, Project Excalibur was, in theory, capable of protecting against a large-scale nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. After about ten ground-based tests, however, the project was cancelled.  **Brilliant Pebbles (Cancelled 1993)**   Another ambitious missile defense scheme proposed under the Reagan-era missile defense effort was the concept of launching missile-killing mini-satellites, each about the size and shape of an American football. Like the Excalibur laser, it was criticised for its technical complexity and cost. In theory, the mini-satellites would hone in on and collide with ballistic missiles as they travelled outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. It was eventually cancelled when the Reagan-era projects were scaled back in favour of the ground-based missile defense scheme, which lives on to today in the form of ship- or land-launched interceptor missiles that can \u2013 when all goes to plan \u2013 knock down a ballistic missile in flight. If you are wondering how Brilliant Pebbles got its name, it came from the idea that these would be more intelligent and smaller than a type of guided missiles, then known as \u201csmart rocks\u201d.  **Space Based Laser (Cancelled 2002)   **Started by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) as the Alpha High Energy Laser, and then later transferred to the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the Space Based Laser was supposed to lead to a megawatt class laser that could shoot down missiles. Unlike Excalibur, however, the Space Based Laser was to be based on a chemical laser, and thus didn\u2019t require setting off nuclear explosions in space. What ensued, however, was years of cost overruns and schedule delays, as the Pentagon and contractors struggled with the complexity of putting a chemical laser in space with a mirror that could reflect the beam and a tracking system that would allow it to hone in on a missile. Though work on the idea of a Space Based Laser continued for years after the Strategic Defense Initiative was cancelled, by 2002, the director of the Missile Defense Agency announced that it was being shelved. The laser never made it to space.  **Airborne Laser (Cancelled 2009)   **The notion failed as much because of the plans for how it would be used stretched the imagination of military planners. A fleet of Boeing 747 aircraft equipped with lasers would circle the planet waiting for a possible missile attack. Once such an attack was imminent, the aircraft would swoop in and intercept the missile during its vulnerable \u201cboost phase\u201d. Integrating the laser on the aircraft and demonstrating it could work as promised proved daunting: problems such as atmospheric turbulence, which affects beam propagation, proved difficult to solve. The laser also required dangerous chemicals to operate. After years of development and billions spent, then Defense Secretary Robert Gates cancelled the programme, saying its \u201cproposed operational role is highly questionable.\u201d  **Eighth Card (Cancelled late 1960s)   **Reportedly named for a reference to a card game trick that would give the United States the upper hand over the Soviet Union, this once top-secret laser programme was based on a gas-dynamic _carbon_ dioxide _laser that was supposed to reach 500 kilowatts. Numerous reviews eventually determined that, among other problems, scaling it up in power while maintaining the beam quality would be impractical. ___  **Project Seesaw (Cancelled late 1960s)**   In the 1960s, the U.S. government funded the top-secret project, which looked at the feasibility of particle beams for missile defense. Bounced between various agencies, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency (now known as Darpa), the project literally see-sawed between evaluations that deemed it theoretically feasible, or practically impossible. Eventually the latter evaluation won out, and no particle beam was developed.  **Project Argus (Cancelled approximately 1959)**   In 1958, the United States carried out a series of top-secret nuclear tests meant to test a missile defense theory forwarded by an eccentric physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The concept was that nuclear weapons detonated in the upper atmosphere would create an artificial radiation belt capable of stopping incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles\u2014a sort of atmospheric missile shield. Though the tests were hailed as successful the scheme, at the time dubbed \u201cthe greatest scientific experiment ever conducted\u201d, was deemed impractical, if not impossible, for stopping nuclear attacks, and never went beyond testing.  _If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook page__ or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The most outlandish ideas for missile defence systems", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130805-rise-and-fall-of-missile-defences", "countriesMentioned": ["United States", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Sharon Weinberger"},{"newsText": "In 1504, an anonymous mapmaker \u2013 most likely an Italian \u2013 carved a meticulous depiction of the known world into two halves of conjoined ostrich eggs. The grapefruit-sized globe included recent breaking discoveries of mysterious distant lands, including Japan, Brazil and the Arabic peninsula. But blanks remained. In a patch of ocean near Southeast Asia, that long-forgotten mapmaker carefully etched the Latin phrase Hic Sunt Dracones \u2013 \u201cHere are the dragons.\u201d  Today it is safe to say there are no unknown territories with dragons. However, it\u2019s not quite true to say that every corner of the planet is charted. We may seem to have a map for everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are complete, accurate or even trustworthy.  For starters, all maps are biased toward their creator\u2019s subjective view of the world. As Lewis Carroll famously pointed out, a perfectly objective and faithful 1:1 representation of the world would literally have to be the same size as the place it depicted. Therefore, mapmakers must make sensible design decisions in order to compress the physical world into a much smaller, flatter depiction. Those decisions inevitably introduce personal biases, however, such as our tendency to place ourselves at the centre of the world. \u201cWe always want to put ourselves on the map,\u201d says Jerry Brotton, a professor of renaissance studies at Queen Mary University London, and author of A History of the World in 12 Maps. \u201cMaps address an existential question as much as one that\u2019s about orientation and coordinates.  \u201cWe want to find ourselves on the map, but at the same time, we are also outside of the map, rising above the world and looking down as if we were god,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a transcendental experience.\u201d  Which is why, he says, the first thing most new Google Earth users do is to look up their own address. Modern technology enables this exercise in ego, but the tendency itself is nothing new. It dates back to the oldest known world map, a 2,500-year-old cuneiform tablet discovered near Baghdad that puts Babylon at its centre. Mapmakers throughout history adopted a similar bias toward their own homeland, and little seems to have changed since then. Today, American maps still tend to centre on America; Japanese maps on Japan; and Chinese ones on China. Some Australian maps are even rotated so that the southern hemisphere is on top. It\u2019s such an ego-centric approach that the United Nations sought to avoid it when they created their emblem \u2013 a map of the world neutrally centered on the North Pole.  Similarly, maps can overestimate their creators\u2019 geographic worth, or reveal bias against certain places. Africa\u2019s true size, for example, has been chronically downplayed throughout the history of mapmaking, and even now, non- Africans tend to underestimate the size of that truly massive continent \u2013 which is large enough to cover China, the US and much of Europe.  Religious, political and economic agendas also come into play, adulterating a map\u2019s objectivity. The maps of World War II, for example, were incredibly propagandist, depicting \u201cdreadful red bears and red perils,\u201d Brotton says. \u201cThe maps were distorted to tell a political message.  \u201cA map,\u201d he continues, \u201cwill always have an agenda, an argument, a proposal about what the world looks like from a particular perspective.\u201d  **Skewed view**  Even today\u2019s digital maps adhere to this rule, he says. Google and other digital mapmakers turn the world into \u201cone enormous web browser\u201d, he explains, driven by commercial interests.  But Manik Gupta, the group product manager at Google Maps, counters that Google Maps\u2019 primary goal mirrors that of its company: to organise the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Commerce is just one part of that. \u201cAt the end of the day, technology is a tool,\u201d Gupta says. \u201cOur job is to make sure it\u2019s super accurate and works. Users then decide how they want to use it.\u201d  Nevertheless, even digital maps skew toward the things that their users deem most important. Those areas that the majority sees as unworthy of attention \u2013 poor neighbourhoods like the Orangi shanty town in Karachi, Pakistan, or the Neza-Chalco-Itza slum in Mexico city \u2013 as well as those places that mapmakers do not often go \u2013 war-torn regions, North Korea \u2013 remain grossly undermapped.  This neglect means maps of remote regions can contain errors that go unnoticed for years. Scientists paying a visit to Sandy Island, a speck of land in the Coral Sea near New Caledonia, recently discovered that the island simply did not exist. The \u201cphantom island\u201d had found its way onto Australian maps and Google Earth at least a decade ago, probably due to human error.  Google has two approaches to addressing these problems: sending mapmakers out into the wilderness with Street View cameras attached to backpacks, bikes, boats or snowmobiles, and launching Map Maker, a tool created in 2008 that allows anyone anywhere to enhance existing Google maps. \u201cIf it\u2019s important, then most likely the users will put it on the map,\u201d Gupta says.  But while many communities have literally put themselves on the map, others have not. (Most likely, mapping Rio de Janeiro\u2019s favelas or the floating slum of Makoko in Lagos isn\u2019t a top priority for those living there.) Traditional paper maps tend to neglect these areas as well. \u201cThey\u2019re places that the state denies or doesn\u2019t want to portray as part of its landscape,\u201d says Alexander Kent, a senior lecturer in geography and GIS at Canterbury Christ Church University in the UK. \u201cFar from being something objective that just reflects what\u2019s on the ground, the person behind the map has the power to determine what goes on it or not.\u201d  In recognition of this problem, a new effort called the Missing Maps Project \u2013 organised by the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team \u2013 recruits volunteers to fill in the cartographical blanks in the developing world. It\u2019s too early to tell whether the project will make a substantial dent, but launch parties are scheduled in London and Jakarta to try and drum up interest among potential volunteers.  The ocean, likewise, is one of the most poorly mapped areas of the planet, despite the fact that it occupies the most space. \u201cThe great terra incognita is the ocean bed,\u201d Brotton says. In light of increasing interest in underwater mining and drilling, certain countries \u2013 especially Russia \u2013 are looking to lay claim on large tracts of ocean floor. Additionally, with sea ice quickly receding, more and more territory will come up for grabs. \u201cAs the landscape changes, it becomes possible to exploit more mineral resources, so mapping becomes extremely powerful and important,\u201d Brotton says. To draw attention to this gap of knowledge, Brotton and artist Adam Lowe are creating a 3D map of the ocean floor without water. \u201cI think geographers are beginning to understand that mapping the oceans is one of the great untold stories,\u201d he says.  **Low quality**  For others, though, untold stories abound even in some of the most prolifically mapped places in the world. Dave Imus, an award-winning mapmaker based in Oregon, acknowledges that much of the world has been mapped in a basic sense, but believes that the vast majority of maps are not good enough.  \u201cSo many maps are difficult to understand, forcing the eye and mind to work overtime trying to perceive what it\u2019s looking at,\u201d he says. And a digital map, with spoken directions, \u201cis good for helping you find a restaurant, but you\u2019re no more connected with your surroundings than looking for the next turn\u201d.  Frustrated with the maps on offer for the US, he set out to make his own, turning to the \u201creally exquisite, expressive\u201d mapping style of Swiss cartographers as inspiration. \u201cIt\u2019s my hypothesis that the reason Europeans are so much more geographically aware than we Americans is that they have these maps that make their surroundings understandable and we don\u2019t,\u201d he says.  The fruit of his labour is the Essential Geography of the United States of America, a highly informative map that does away with the muddle of rainbow- coloured states of traditional US maps, instead delineating boundaries in green and allowing each state\u2019s actual features \u2013 mountains, forests, lakes, urban centres, highways \u2013 to characterise those places. City populations are indicated in yellow patches, and rather than cram in as many towns as possible, Imus uses census data to standardise rural places in terms of what counts as a hub in that particular area \u2013 whether that means 500 or 5,000 people. Major landmarks and transportation centres like airports are marked; Native American reserves are included (something lacking on many maps); and elevation of not only of mountains but also cities is noted. \u201cThe National Geographic map of the US has some elevations of mountain peaks but doesn\u2019t even tell you the elevation of Denver, Colorado,\u201d Imus says. \u201cAs a consequence, it doesn\u2019t communicate anything meaningful about what that place is like if you\u2019ve never been there.\u201d  **High standard**  Such maps are incredibly time consuming and expensive to produce, however. Imus spent 6,000 hours on his. As a result, as far as Imus knows, only Europe, Japan, New Zealand and now the US have maps available that meet these high standards. \u201cWe think we\u2019re living in this modern age and everything\u2019s been done, but for people who look at mapping at a slightly different angle, they\u2019ll see things that still need to be done virtually everywhere,\u201d he says. Still, Imus dreams of a day when such maps will be widely available everywhere and at increasingly fine scales, such as at the state and city level. Ultimately, he hopes this would foster a more geographically literate society. \u201cI\u2019ve felt misunderstood at times,\u201d Imus says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve gotten so much great feedback on this project that I feel like people now get it and it\u2019ll continue on.\u201d  But even the most detailed maps cannot get around one fundamental problem in the way of creating a near-perfect cartographic representation for any place in the world: the incredible pace of change, both human and nature-made, that characterises life on the planet. Some cities in Asia and Africa, Gupta says, are undergoing so much construction that Google Maps have been unable to keep up. At the same time, natural landscapes are constantly in a state of flux \u2013 now, more so than ever. Islands are being devoured by the sea, ice floes are disappearing, shorelines are eroding and forests are being cleared. \u201cThe very moment you build a perfect map of the world is the moment it goes out of date,\u201d Gupta says. \u201cThe real world will always be a little bit ahead of how we represent it, because change is constant.\u201d  In that sense, the entire world is undermapped, and it will always remain that way. A birds-eye view of a city tells you it\u2019s there, but not how to navigate through all corners of it. A foldout map is a relic of the time it went to print, unable to take into account earthquake destruction, new roads or renegotiated borders. And Google Maps can provide turn-by-turn instructions for biking from London to Brighton, but fails utterly when asked to do the same for traversing a Brazilian favela or the Gobi desert\u2019s dunes.  Even our best maps, then, are merely more up to date and truer to place than others. Our age-old quest to capture uncharted land and space will never end.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The last unmapped places on Earth", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141127-the-last-unmapped-places", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "Rachel Nuwer"},{"newsText": "Three billion tonnes of crude oil and refined products are shipped on huge tanker vessels worldwide every year. But recently, some of these ships have stopped. In fact, since March, many more than is usual have simply been anchored off ports like Singapore and Rotterdam in the Netherlands \u2013 and it\u2019s not immediately clear why.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) has been monitoring the situation. It has tracked just under 94 million barrels of unrefined crude oil in what\u2019s known as \u201cfloating storage\u201d at the end of May. And Clarksons, a shipping analyst firm in London, says it has tracked an increase from 85 to 120 oil tankers at anchor around the world.  To measure these things, Clarksons tracks ships visually with satellite imagery and compares this to known information about how oil is being traded in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a bit of detective work trying to piece all those bits of information together,\u201d says Simon Chattrabhuti, a market analyst at the firm.  The Clarksons figure covers a range of ships from 55,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) to 440,000 dwt \u2013 including 55 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) of 279,000 dwt to 320,000 dwt and two Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCCs) of 320,000 dwt or more. The VLCC figure has risen by 18 since March.  These are big ships, and 90 million barrels is a lot of crude oil. Usually the amount stored floating is no more than about 70 million, according to the IEA. Why this increase?  Some have questioned whether a floating storage \u201ccontango\u201d has unfolded. This is a situation in which oil traders keep oil at sea until the price rises \u2013 effectively making money while doing nothing. However, the price of oil, while steadily rising again, isn\u2019t actually going up quickly enough for this to make economic sense. Keeping oil on tankers isn\u2019t cheap as there are shipping rates and insurance costs involved.  > The real reason, most experts think, is that there just aren\u2019t enough places to offload oil at ports  The real reason, most experts think, is that there just aren\u2019t enough places to offload oil at ports \u2013 onshore storage tanks are full. This is thanks to a recent glut of oil, far more than is necessary for demand, which has both lowered the price of oil around the world and flooded storage with unwanted stock.  \u201cTraders have been sending cargo to Singapore,\u201d explains Andrew Wilson at the IEA, \u201cbut they can\u2019t find the land-based terminals to offload it.  \u201cAt key terminals we have seen capacity being built out over the last five years, but stocks have ballooned.\u201d  Wilson says that the amount of stored oil at Rotterdam is \u201capproaching record levels\u201d for example. And we\u2019re not just talking about crude oil: some anchored ships off ports like Singapore, appear to be storing large amounts of bunker fuel, a refined product used by ships but not in especially high demand at the moment. This all appears to have happened because global oil supplies have far outstripped demand in the last year or two.  An interesting situation has also developed off the coast of Iran, where some large oil tankers are also anchored. Until January, there were sanctions prohibiting the export of Iranian oil. While those sanctions were in place, some of the country\u2019s oil was stored offshore. It\u2019s not clear why those stocks haven\u2019t moved since sanctions have lifted but Wilson again thinks it\u2019s a logistical issue. Some of those ships are storing a type of oil called condensate and not all refineries can process it thanks to a high number of impurities.  What will happen next? Tim Smith at London shipping consultants MSI believes that now the price of oil is rising again, stocks will begin to move onshore and into refineries at a greater rate, easing the floating storage situation.  \u201cAs prices increase, you\u2019d expect refineries to be looking at drawing down some of those stocks,\u201d he says.  > As oil stored on land gets sucked up, more will have to come off those ships to replace it  Plus, there is a seasonal variation in how refineries work. The spring and summer period, following maintenance earlier in the year, is usually when production levels soar at these facilities. As oil stored on land gets sucked up, more will have to come off those ships to replace it.  Andrew Wilson adds that the IEA\u2019s current prediction is that floating storage of crude will return to around 70 million barrels throughout the rest of the year.  Still, while we have a better idea of what\u2019s going on, the picture with oil is always a little bit murky.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of those stories where traders are the key and traders don\u2019t let you know about what they\u2019re doing,\u201d notes Michelle Wiese Bockmann at oil industry analysts OPIS Tanker Tracker.  And there are further complications. Earlier this month, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), failed to reach an agreement over oil production levels \u2013 agreed caps would theoretically help to ensure that supply doesn\u2019t continue to overstep demand. If supply booms and oil prices fall again, it might make the floating storage situation worse.  Bockmann says all of this should be viewed in context, though. In 2009, the IEA tracked 112 million barrels of crude oil at sea \u2013 compared to the 94 million we are seeing today. Plus, there was a further 58 million barrels of oil products \u2013 170 million barrels in total. At the time that was unprecedented and led to a true contango in which oil was traded offshore for economic gain.  \u201cI\u2019m certainly not seeing anything like that at the moment,\u201d says Bockmann.  \\--  _Join 600,000+ Future fans by liking us on __Facebook__, or follow us on __Twitter__, __Google+__, __LinkedIn__ and __Instagram__._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0__sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter__, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Due to be adopted by major air forces in the decades to come, it was supposed to be the star of the show. But in the end, the $100m-a-unit jet failed to turn up to its coming-out party after an engine fire in one of the production models grounded the fleet.  But another new jet fighter, which had taken less than two years to design, build and fly, did make it to Farnborough. The Textron Scorpion costs $20m, still not exactly a bargain by most people's standards, but a fifth of the cost of the F-35. It suggests that not every advanced defence project has to necessarily come in years late and billions over budget \u2013 and points to a new twist in not only the future of fighter-jet design, but also in more humanitarian roles that a budget jet could carry out.  As Textron AirLand president Bill Anderson has said, the majority of work devoted to designing and developing fighters over the last several decades has focused on creating expensive, sophisticated machines. Whether it's Lockheed\u2019s F-35 and F-22 Raptor, the Eurofighter Typhoon or the Boeing F/A-18, the designs have reflected the desire for advanced performance over affordability. Yet in today's economic environment, cost is becoming an unavoidably compelling issue for even the richest western nations.  **Budget busters   **   Textron aren\u2019t the only ones creating the tech to address this issue. The single jet fighter JF-17 is a Chinese design, currently being built in collaboration with its sole export customer, Pakistan, and is said to be available for around the same per-plane price of US$20m. Meanwhile, a Russian design, the Yak-130, has also been touted as a low-cost plane to carry out everything from air combat to reconnaissance, as well as train pilots.  This isn't the first time plane-makers have offered cheaper designs. The list of current and former operators of the Russian MiG-21 \u2013 a 1950s design still going strong today - reads like a who's who of the former Soviet bloc. And other nations who have more recently bought China\u2019s modern upgrades of this old Soviet model show that cheap fighter planes are still a prized purchase for cash-strapped air forces.****  The US used to create such designs as well; in the 1960s and 70s, air forces that couldn\u2019t afford the heavy, twin-engined F-4 Phantom were offered the light, adaptable F-5 Freedom Fighter. The F-5 ended up serving in more than 30 air forces, and a reverse-engineered version built in Iran has just entered service with the Iranian Air Force.  There are three main classes of potential customers for planes like the Scorpion, which has a top speed of around 520mph. The first are air forces who want a small jet aircraft capable of carrying out a range of strike and intelligence-gathering missions, and who have either never flown combat jets before or are looking to replace older aircraft. The second are countries who already have, or are developing, high-end fighter forces, but who might buy fewer of the more expensive jets to obtain a larger number of cheaper aircraft. The third are the major military powers who will need the advanced jets for simpler missions in low-risk environments.  But how exactly do you make something as complex and technologically challenging as a fighter plane cheaper? Textron looked to its existing suppliers and used components that were already in production, rather than designing everything from scratch (the F-35, for example, uses an engine which was developed especially for the aircraft). The development team was deliberately kept very small, so Anderson and Scorpion chief designer, Dale Tutt, could make decisions quickly.  \"Once we'd developed the initial design concept we set high-level design requirements for the team, and we didn't overburden them with a lot of detailed requirements,\" Tutt says. \u201cWe didn't have to invest time in developing, for example, a new engine or ejection seat. We were able to focus on putting those components together for the airplane and get it flying.\"  **Patrol role**  Textron also had the advantage of not having to meet the requirements of a specific nation or an air force. This meant that the development team could make changes to the design if they felt it would help the overall project.  \"A great example is [British ejection-seat specialists] Martin Baker,\" says Anderson. \"They sent a group of engineers over and they looked at our cockpit cup design, and they said, 'Well, our seat's not gonna work. It'll be several million dollars and 18 months for us to redesign it. But if you can give us about five more inches of volume - three in length and two in width \u2013 it will work.' So guess what we did? We made the cockpit tub a little bigger.\"  The Scorpion followed its Farnborough appearance with a demonstration at an exercise in Textron's home state of Kansas, designed to simulate the aftermath of a natural disaster (a major tornado strike) on the region. The jet wasn't used in a fighter role: instead it supplied full-motion video surveillance footage to ground commanders, in a role much like the one carried out today by drones in Afghanistan. Textron wants to enter the Scorpion in the competition the US Air Force will run next year to buy 350 jet trainers to replace its obsolete fleet of T-38s, which have been serving since the 1960s. It also points to additional roles, such as border surveillance, humanitarian assistance and maritime patrol, as jobs the jet can also comfortably carry out.  \"Even among the very wealthy countries we're speaking to, everyone is recognising we have to become more economical,\" Anderson stresses. \"No doubt we need high-end fighters: but pilots need to fly, and we can't afford the airplanes we have and to fly the pilots enough to make them combat-sufficient. I think most countries recognise that you don't always need a high-end aircraft.\u201d  _If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter_.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The low-cost fighters to serve tomorrows air forces", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140903-low-cost-fighter-jets-take-off", "countriesMentioned": ["Pakistan", "Iran, Islamic Republic of", "Afghanistan", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "author": "Angus Batey"},{"newsText": "You might expect a great philosopher to look past our surface into the depths of the soul \u2013 but Ancient Greek thinkers were surprisingly concerned with appearance. Aristotle and his followers even compiled a volume of the ways that your looks could reflect your spirit.  \"Soft hair indicates cowardice and coarse hair courage,\" they wrote. Impudence, the treatise says, was evident in \"bright, wise-open eyes with heavy blood-shot lids\"; a broad nose, meanwhile, was a sign of laziness, like in cattle.  Sensuous, fleshy lips fared little better. The philosophers saw it as a sign of folly, \"like an ass\", while those with especially thin mouths were thought to be proud, like lions.  Today, we are taught not to judge a book by its cover. But while it is wise not to set too much by appearances, psychologists are finding that your face offers a window on our deepest secrets. Even if you keep a stony poker face, your features can reveal details about your personality, your health, and your intelligence.  **Assertive structure**  \u201cThe idea is that our biology, like genes and hormone levels, influences our growth, and the same mechanisms will also shape our character,\u201d explains Carmen Lefevre at Northumbria University.  Consider the face\u2019s bone structure \u2013 whether it is relatively short and wide or long and thin. Lefevre has found that people with higher levels of testosterone tend to be wider-faced with bigger cheekbones, and they are also more likely to have more assertive, and sometimes aggressive, personalities.  The link between face shape and dominance is surprisingly widespread, from capuchin monkeys \u2013 the wider the face, the more likely they are to hold a higher rank in the group\u2019s hierarchy \u2013 to professional football players. Examining the 2010 World Cup, Keith Welker at the University of Boulder, Colorado, recently showed that the ratio of the width and height of the footballers\u2019 faces predicted both the number of fouls among midfielders, and the number of goals scored by the forwards.  (To calculate this yourself, compare the distance from ear-to-ear with the distance between the top of your eyes, and your upper lip. The average ratio of width-to-height\u00a0 is around 2 \u2013 Abraham Lincoln was 1.93)  It may even clue you in to a politician\u2019s motives. Using volunteers to rate former US presidents on different psychological attributes, Lefevre found that face shape seemed to reflect their perceived ambition and drive. John F Kennedy had a thicker-set face than 19th Century Chester Arthur, for instance. Such analyses of historical figures are perhaps best taken with a pinch of salt, however, and it has to be said that other traits, such as cooperation and intelligence, should be equally important for success.  **Plump cheeks**  As you might expect, your health and medical history are also written in your countenance \u2013 and the detail it offers is surprising. The amount of fat on your face, for instance, provides a stronger indication of your fitness than more standard measures, such as your body mass index. Those with thinner faces are less likely to suffer infections, and when they do, the illness is less severe; they also tend to have lower rates of depression and anxiety, probably because mental health is often closely related to the body\u2019s fitness in general.  How could the plumpness of your cheeks say so much about you? Benedict Jones at the University of Glasgow thinks a new understanding of fat\u2019s role in the body may help explain it. \u201cHow healthy you are isn\u2019t so much about how much fat you have, but where you have that fat,\u201d he says. Pear-shaped people, with more weight around the hips and bottom but slimmer torsos, tend to be healthier than \u201capples\u201d with a spare tyre around the midriff, since the adipose tissue around the chest is thought to release inflammatory molecules that can damage the core organs. Perhaps the fullness of your face reflects the fatty deposits in the more harmful areas, Jones says. Or it could be that facial fat is itself dangerous for some reason.  Besides these more overt cues, very subtle differences in skin colour can also reveal your health secrets. Jones and Lefevre emphasise this has nothing to do with the tones associated with ethnicity, but barely-noticeable tints that may reflect differences in lifestyle. You appear to be in more robust health, for instance, if your skin has a slightly yellowish, golden tone. The pigments in question are called carotenoids, which, as the name suggest, can be found in orange and red fruit and veg. Carotenoids help build a healthy immune system, says Lefevre. \u201cBut when we\u2019ve eaten enough, they layer in the skin and dye it yellow. We exhibit them, because we haven\u2019t used them to battle illness.\u201d The glow of health, in turn, contributes significantly to your physical attraction \u2013 more so, in fact, than the more overt tones that might accompany a trip to the tanning salon.  A blush of pink, meanwhile, should signal the good circulation that comes with an active lifestyle \u2013 and it might also be a sign of a woman\u2019s fertility. Jones has found that women tend to adopt a slightly redder flush at the peak of the menstrual cycle, perhaps because estradiol, a sex hormone, leads the blood vessels in the cheek to dilate slightly. It may be one of many tiny shifts in appearance and behaviour that together make a woman slightly more attractive when she is most likely to conceive.  **Looking smart**  As Jones points out, these secrets were hiding in plain sight \u2013 yet we were slow to uncover them. At the very least, this knowledge helps restore the reputation of \u201cphysiognomy\u201d, which has suffered a somewhat chequered reputation since Aristotle\u2019s musings. Tudor king Henry VIII was so sceptical of the idea that he even banned quack \u201cprofessors\u201d from profiting from their readings, and its status took a second bashing in the early 20th Century, when it was associated with phrenology \u2013 the mistaken idea that lumps and bumps on your head can predict your behaviour.  But now the discipline is gaining credibility, we may find that there are many more surprises hiding in your selfies. Intriguingly, we seem to be able to predict intelligence from someone\u2019s face with modest accuracy \u2013 though it\u2019s not yet clear what specific cues make someone look smart. (Needless to say, it is not as simple as whether or not they wear glasses.) Others are examining the \u201cgaydar\u201d. We often can guess someone\u2019s sexual orientation within a split- second, even when there are no stereotypical clues, but it\u2019s still a mystery as to what we\u2019re actually reading. Further research might explain exactly how we make these snap judgements.  It will also be interesting to see how the link between personality, lifestyle and appearance changes across the lifetime. One study managed to examine records of personality and appearance, following subjects from the 1930s to the 1990s. The scientists found that although baby-faced men tended to be less dominant in their youth, they grew to be more assertive as the years wore on \u2013 perhaps because they learnt to compensate for the expectations brought about by their puppyish appearance.  More intriguingly, the authors also found evidence of a \u201cDorian Gray effect\u201d \u2013 where the ageing face began to reflect certain aspects of the personality that hadn\u2019t been obvious when the people were younger. Women who had more attractive, sociable, personalities from adolescence to their 30s slowly started to climb in physical attractiveness, so that in their 50s they were considered better-looking than those who had been less personable but naturally prettier. One possibility is that they simply knew how to make the best of their appearance, and that their inner confidence was reflected on subtle differences in expression.  After all, there is so much more to our appearance than the bone structure and skin tone, as one particularly clever study recently demonstrated. The scientists asked volunteers to wear their favourite clothes, and then took a photo of their face. Even though the clothes themselves were not visible in the mugshots, impartial judges considered them to be considerably more attractive than other pictures of the participants. The finding is particularly striking, considering that they were asked to keep neutral expressions: somehow, the boosted self-esteem shone through anyway.  Our faces aren\u2019t just the product of our biology. We can\u2019t change our genes or our hormones \u2013 but by cultivating our personality and sense of self-worth, they may begin to mirror something far more important.  _Share this story on __Facebook__, __Google+__ or __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - How your face betrays your personality and health", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150312-what-the-face-betrays-about-you", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States", "Australia", "New Zealand", "Brazil", "Argentina"], "author": "David Robson"},{"newsText": "In many places on our planet, striking oil has meant the eruption of new settlements in previously uninhabited places.

A future when you can hop in and have a sleep while an autonomous vehicle takes you to your destination appears to be closer than anyone thought just five years ago.  Getting there, however, will involve quite a few stages, with cars getting more and more autonomous but human drivers still having some role. Or will it?  A report by Bloomberg says Ford is going to skip a step and go straight to fully autonomous driving. The article says that is because engineers who are testing the company's self-driving vehicles are falling asleep at the wheel because there is so little for them to do.  Ford tells me that only part of this story is true: \"Reports that Ford engineers were falling asleep while testing autonomous vehicles are inaccurate.\"  But it goes on to say that \"high levels of automation without full autonomy capability could provide a false sense of security\".  That means it is difficult for the driver to suddenly take control if there is a situation where the technology is not up to it. And that's why it is going to head straight to what is known as SAE level four - \"autonomous capability that will take the driver completely out of the driving process in defined areas\".  SAE is a global organisation of automotive engineers that has come up with a definition of six levels of automation, from zero - where the driver is in full control - to five, where the car does everything in all circumstances.  In January, at CES in Las Vegas, Ford's Ken Washington told me confidently that the company would have a fully autonomous car on the road by 2021: \"The vehicles we are going to put in our 2021 fully autonomous ride service will not have a steering wheel, they won't have a brake pedal,\" he explained.  \"So this means there's no issue with drivers having to take over control because the vehicle will know how to handle all scenarios.\"  ## Building up trust  Most of the car industry seems to believe that the evolution of automation will be a more gradual affair, with drivers slowly learning to trust their cars to do ever more. But I can see why Ford sees a problem with a halfway house, where the driver only occasionally needs to take over.  Last year, I drove a Tesla in Autopilot mode down an American freeway - and found it a nerve-wracking experience. My hands hovered over the steering wheel and my foot over the brake, ready to act if needed. As the technology improves, perhaps we will get more relaxed about taking our hands off the wheel, eating a sandwich or watching a video - but that could then make us less capable of responding quickly when we need to take over.  That is why Ford wants to move swiftly to full autonomy - but is that practical? I caught up with a leading British figure in this field, Professor Paul Newman, whose Oxbotica firm is developing autonomous vehicles.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Google's autonomous cars look less conventional  He thought Ford was serious about that 2021 target but stressed that what it was promising was not a car that would drive itself anywhere but what he called \"mobility as a service\". The vehicles would be owned by the company and would operate as a sort of autonomous taxi: \"It would be a limited service on specific routes. Just like a bus can't go anywhere, you would only operate this where you were confident that it would work.\"  Professor Newman believes that we will first see fully autonomous vehicles operating at quite slow speeds in cities rather than on motorways. \"The trick is then to have the machines learn through use and ever expand their domains.\"  So we have two competing strategies. Most of the car industry is looking to build ever more autonomous capabilities into something that will still look like a traditional car, in the expectation that it will take until 2030 to reach the full autonomy of SAE level five.  But both Ford and Google seem confident that building vehicles that won't look so familiar will get them to level four - full autonomy in defined areas. They hope that will change the way we think about road transport far more quickly.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had informed his US counterpart Hillary Clinton of Moscow's decision.  \"We will bar entry to Americans who are in fact guilty of human rights violations,\" he said.  The US bill, adopted by Congress on Thursday, normalises trade with Russia, but blacklists Russian rights abusers.  The legislation passed by large majorities in the House and Senate, and President Barack Obama is expected to sign it into law.  Under the bill, the US would withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations.  The Russian foreign ministry called the bill \"a performance in the theatre of the absurd\".  It warned that the measure would have a \"very negative impact on the prospects for bilateral co-operation\".  \"It's strange and wild to hear such claims about human rights addressed to us by politicians of the very state where in the 21st Century torture and the kidnapping of people all over the world were officially legalised,\" the ministry said.  Mr Lavrov announced Moscow's retaliation following talks on the Syria conflict with Mrs Clinton and special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in Dublin on Thursday.  ## New trade rules  > It's a shame and an outrage that the USA imposes sanctions on these bandits and butchers, while Russia hides and protects themAlexei Navalny, Russian opposition blogger  The US trade measure eliminates a long-obsolete 1974 provision, called the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, that tied trade relations with the former Soviet Union to the emigration of Jews and other Soviet minorities.  Russia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in August, and must open its market and reduce tariffs under the terms of its membership.  With the old trade restrictions in place, the US was the only WTO member that could not take advantage of Russia's market reform.  However, lingering congressional anger about human rights abuses and anti- American policies helped attach the Magnitsky Act to the larger trade bill.  The measure is named after Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison three years ago after allegedly being tortured.  Under the Magnitsky sanctions, the US must release a list of Russian officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations, and deny them visas and freeze their assets.  ## 'Punish the scum'  Leading Russian opposition blogger Alexei Navalny, who has long campaigned for transparency, welcomed the proposed US blacklist as a piece of \"pro-Russian\" legislation.  \"Our foreign ministry has called this 'a performance in the theatre of the absurd',\" he wrote on his blog.  \"To use another metaphor, I'd call this kind of behaviour by our ministry and officials, who are in horror of these sanctions, 'a fire in a brothel'.  \"The Magnitsky Act is totally pro-Russian.

Towering over the entrance is the white cone of the Rotary Rocket, a radical launch system that is half rocket, half helicopter. The fully reusable craft, developed in the 1990s, was supposed to reduce the cost of launching payloads into orbit by a factor of ten. In the end, the rocket failed literally and metaphorically to get far off the ground. But Stuart Witt, CEO of the spaceport, the vehicle is a daily reminder of the \u2018can do\u2019 attitude he hopes to encourage.  \u201cHumanity needs a place where people are encouraged and allowed to take incredible risks in order to have breakthroughs,\u201d exclaims Witt. \u201cThat has turned out to be our greatest magnetism: offering permission to people who are willing to try.\u201d  The Air and Space Port, two hours drive north of Los Angeles, has become one of the most exciting \u2013 and least talked about \u2013 places in the modern space industry. Over the last 12 years, this vast expanse of flat, scrubby desert has hosted more than 6,000 rocket tests and is now home to 14 space companies. If you can cope with the blistering heat, a short walk along the runway will take you past hangers, industrial units and sheds that belong to The Spaceship Company, Virgin Galactic, XCOR Aerospace and Masten Space Systems.  So far, the only craft they\u2019ve flown into space is SpaceShipOne, a ship that is the template for Virgin Galactic\u2019s space tourism venture. Nevertheless, the area is now spoken of by some as a new Silicon Valley or, as Witt prefers, a new Kitty Hawk \u2013 the North Carolina backwater where the Wright brothers experimented with powered flight. Whatever the comparison, the thrust is still the same. Mojave is a place where people dare to try.  \u201cYou need a place where people have permission to do these things. Western society has become enormously risk averse in the last 30 years,\u201d Witt explains. \u201cHere in the States your kid can\u2019t ride a tricycle unless they\u2019re wearing a helmet, or you\u2019ll get a ticket or go to jail. There are so many things you can\u2019t do, it permeates the society in which you live.\u201d  **Big bang**  If the set up at Mojave all sounds a little \u2018Right Stuff\u2019, with fearless test pilots pushing the boundaries of Earth, then that\u2019s not far off the mark. Nor is it far away. Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier in the X-1 rocket plane at nearby Edwards Air Force Base in 1947. And the first orbital Space Shuttle flight landed there as well. Mojave shares the same restricted air space, which allows supersonic test flights. But it\u2019s not just about pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible; it\u2019s also about pushing the boundaries of what is commercially possible.  \u201cOur big plan is to bring down the cost of space transportation,\u201d explains Dave Masten, the founder of Masten Space Systems, \u201cwhether that\u2019s just going up to the edge of space in a sub-orbital vehicle or going all the way to Mars.\u201d  Masten is best known for developing rockets but he rarely speaks to journalists \u2013 after all, one of the other reasons space companies come to Mojave is to stay out of the public eye. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s short on ambition.  \u201cWe looked at the airline industry and said: \u2018how many people does it actually take to maintain and fly a 747?\u2019 and \u2018how many people does it take to support a single launch of a single Space Shuttle?\u2019 We want to get that down closer to how an airline operates and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d  Over the last few months, Masten\u2019s unmanned Xaero rocket has been making regular atmospheric flights from Mojave. After 110 flights, it recently crashed as a result of a mid-air engine failure. Not that that\u2019s deterring anyone. \u201cWe\u2019re building the next vehicle already and we should have it flying within the next couple of weeks,\u201d says Masten.  Down the road, inside the workshops at XCOR Aerospace, engineers are testing a rocket ignition system. As I walk in, I\u2019m instructed to put on bulky ear defenders and stand well back. The resulting bang is still loud enough to make me jump as it reverberates around the workbenches, racks of tools and heavy machinery lining the walls.  The company\u2019s Lynx sub-orbital space plane is being promoted to carry space tourists (and has already been featured in this column). On the other side of the XCOR hanger, the vehicle is gradually taking shape \u2013 with a two-person cockpit dwarfed by the enormous rocket engine behind. Its pipes, wires and nozzles a mass of technical complexity.  **Do or try**  At each of these companies, different ideas are being developed. XCOR\u2019s CEO, Jeff Greason, says it\u2019s an exciting time. \u201cWe\u2019re at the phase of space now that\u2019s like the period in aviation leading up to the First World War, where the configurations differed wildly, with triplanes, or biplanes or monoplanes,\u201d he says.  \u201cThe world is full of self-proclaimed expert opinion on what will or won\u2019t work in space but there\u2019s been remarkably little \u2018let\u2019s go and find out\u2019. It\u2019s time for that to happen now.\u201d  This entrepreneurial can-do attitude runs deep within the start-ups that are drawn to Mojave. It is one of the reasons why it is compared to Silicon Valley. But there are also other parallels \u2013 the hard work, the belief that an idea can change the world as well as the fact that much of the money and founders of these companies came from the computer industry. In the years to come, maybe these workshops will be spoken of with the same awe as the garage where Steve Jobs and Wozniak built the first Apple computers.  But, there is also one other important parallel with Silicon Valley. In Mojave, failure is turned into a positive. The Rotary Rocket, appropriately standing in a small memorial garden alongside a full-sized replica of SpaceShipOne, is a daily reminder of this.  \u201cThere were a lot of people at this airport who worked on that project that never wanted to see it again, there were a lot of people that defined it as a failed project\u201d says Witt. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to find failure in something that became the birthplace for six new companies, all of which are still in business today. That, in itself, is something that needs to be celebrated.

The European Parliament says the trial \"is a violation of international and national laws and clearly shows the malfunctioning of the Russian criminal justice system\".  The Russian interior ministry has accused Mr Magnitsky and the UK-based fund manager who employed him, Bill Browder, of tax evasion. Mr Browder will also be tried - but in absentia, because he believes his life would be in danger were he to return to Russia.  According to a ministry official, Boris Kibis, the Magnitsky case remains open because there has been no request from his relatives to halt it.  Legal experts contacted by the BBC said they could find no parallels for the Magnitsky trial - whether in Russia or internationally. They say there are dubious legal grounds for such a case.  ## Medieval show trial  There is a grisly medieval precedent for putting a dead man on trial - in 897 the then Pope, Stephen VII, held a trial of his predecessor, Formosus, whose body was dug up and propped up on a chair in the papal court.  US law professor Donald Wilkes, of the University of Georgia, has written that Stephen VII \"screamed and raved, hurling insults at and mocking the rotting corpse\" at what was dubbed \"the Cadaver Synod\".  Formosus was found guilty of violating Church law, but the macabre trial caused widespread anger in Rome and within months Pope Stephen VII was overthrown.  Image caption Prison doctor Dmitry Kratov was cleared of negligence in December  Under Russian law the death of the accused means the investigation ought to be stopped, retired Russian judge Tamara Morshchakova told the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Moscow. She formerly served in Russia's Constitutional Court.  Mr Magnitsky's death in prison while on remand in 2009 has become a cause celebre among critics of abuse in the Russian justice system.  Acting on behalf of Hermitage Capital Management, he had exposed an alleged fraud in which government officials had stolen $230m (\u00a3150m) of tax revenue.  But instead of prosecuting any of the alleged embezzlers, the police arrested Mr Magnitsky.  In prison his pancreatitis went untreated and an investigation by the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council concluded that he was a victim of criminal negligence. There is evidence that a beating by prison guards may have killed the chronically ill prisoner, the council reported. His relatives said his body was bruised and finger bones had been broken.  The council also condemned the fact that the same interior ministry officials whom Mr Magnitsky had accused of tax fraud were the ones who handled his arrest and prosecution.  ## International impact  The Magnitsky case has soured Russian-US relations and the European Parliament has urged EU governments to emulate the US Magnitsky Act, which bars entry for Russian officials suspected of human rights violations. Officials on the blacklist can also have their foreign assets frozen under the act.  Nobody has been convicted over the lawyer's death or the alleged theft from state coffers. A prison doctor was acquitted in December, after being accused of negligence.  Image caption Sergei Magnitsky was 37 when he died after a year in detention  Ms Morshchakova said the posthumous trial of Mr Magnitsky was \"very strange\" and \"dangerous\".  \"If such trials were possible then in Russian judicial practice there would be a lot of 'dead souls' in the role of the accused,\" she said.  The exploitation of dead people for personal profit is the theme of Dead Souls, a 19th-Century Russian classic by Nikolai Gogol. The grotesque comedy features a social climber who buys dead serfs from the nobles who owned them.  \"The authorities must halt this travesty,\" Amnesty International said in January.  \"The trial of a deceased person and the forcible involvement of his relatives is a dangerous precedent that would open a whole new chapter in Russia's worsening human rights record,\" Amnesty's Europe and Central Asia Director John Dalhuisen said.  Mr Magnitsky's widow and mother oppose the trial - but the state has appointed defence lawyers anyway to represent Mr Magnitsky and Mr Browder.  Prof Mike Redmayne, a criminal law expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), told BBC News that \"trying a dead person would make as much sense as trying a horse\".  He said there was usually no point trying dead people because trials are about punishment and involve a process of interaction with the accused, including the accused's ability to defend him- or herself. \"It is possible to have a trial in absentia if the defendant disappears, but we rarely do this,\" he said.  ## 'Creative' legal moves  Ella Paneyakh, a sociologist and legal expert at Russia's European University in St Petersburg, said the case illustrated how in President Vladimir Putin's Russia \"they are getting very creative, interpreting the law very literally, in a way which does not correspond to the spirit of the law\".  \"One thing this case says is that there is no real rule of law in Russia, at least in such political issues,\" she told BBC News.  The \"unprecedented\" trial of a dead man, she said, shows that \"so much political capital is already invested in this case, and they need some legal back-up\".  \"Many lawyers are looking at this case now, and if someone knew of a similar case [previously] it would appear on social networks - but it hasn't,\" she said.  Russian law does allow relatives to get a dead person rehabilitated, to restore their reputation - a practice that was common in the post-Stalin thaw under Nikita Khrushchev, to clear the names of people executed or exiled by the Communist Party as \"traitors\" or \"saboteurs\".  The posthumous rehabilitation process allowed old cases to be re-examined, but did not lead to new prosecutions, Ms Paneyakh said. That was frustrating for some Soviet-era dissidents who wanted punishment for those who had sentenced them.  The UK has also reopened some historic cases involving dead people, where there are suspected miscarriages of justice - but that did not mean putting a dead person on trial.", "newsHeadline": "Magnitsky trial: Russia accused of 'travesty' over dead lawyer - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21682470", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "Georgia", "Italy", "Russia", "United States", "United Kingdom"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![A still image from amateur camera phone video shows a covered body in Weybridge with a police car standing nearby, 10 November](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/64454000/jpg/_64454783_64454778.jpg) Image caption An image has been released showing a covered body in Weybridge with a police car nearby  A Russian businessman linked as a witness to a high-profile corruption scandal has been found dead near his home in Weybridge.  Alexander Perepilichnyy had collapsed on a road early on the evening of 10 November, Surrey Police said.  Police are treating the 44-year-old's death as unexplained, pending toxicology tests after an inconclusive post-mortem examination.  Reports have connected Perepilichnyy to the Sergei Magnitsky affair.  Magnitsky, a lawyer for London-based Hermitage Capital Management, died on remand in a Moscow prison three years ago after allegedly uncovering a web of corruption involving Russian tax officials.  According to an article in the Independent newspaper on Wednesday, Perepilichnyy had been giving evidence to Swiss investigators about Russian fraud involving Swiss-based bank accounts.  He had sought sanctuary in the UK three years ago after \"falling out with a powerful crime syndicate\", the paper said.  A Russian media report described Perepilichnyy as a former business partner of one of the people accused by Magnitsky of fraud.  ## 'All the evidence'  News of Perepilichnyy's death more than two weeks ago only emerged on Wednesday.  Police were called to Granville Road in Weybridge shortly after 17:15 GMT, following a report a man had collapsed there.  An ambulance had attended, but Perepilichnyy had been pronounced dead just before 17:40 GMT, Surrey Police said. The force would not confirm suggestions he had been out running.  \"We were made aware of Mr Perepilichnyy's link as a witness in an ongoing trial during the course of the investigation,\" the police said.  According to an article in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Perepilichnyy had lived on a \"luxury private estate shared with seven multi-million pound properties\".  The Swiss Attorney General's office told the Independent Perepilichnyy had given evidence to federal prosecutor Maria Antonella-Bino.  The paper quoted a \"source with knowledge\" of the Swiss fraud inquiry as saying Perepilichnyy had \"brought all the evidence they needed to open the investigation\".  Evidence he had reportedly provided included records of shell or \"front\" companies - which serve as vehicles for business transactions without themselves having any significant assets or operations - bank accounts and property transactions.  ## Notorious case  Image caption Sergei Magnitsky is buried in Moscow  Magnitsky had uncovered the alleged theft by Russian tax officials of more than $200m (\u00a3125m).  Himself detained on suspicion of tax evasion, he died in custody aged 37.  His cause was taken up by human rights groups as one of the most glaring examples of corruption and prison abuse in modern Russia.  He had suffered from pancreatitis and gallstones, and had been found with broken fingers and bruising to his body, the Kremlin's Human Rights Council said in July 2011.

It\u2019s almost 60 years since the launch of Sputnik 1 heralded the birth of the space age. Since then people have walked on the moon, robotic rovers have trundled across the Martian surface and a wealth of probes have explored the worlds in our solar system \u2013 most recently, Pluto. But the space industry has typically been the preserve of governments \u2013 only they have had the pockets deep enough to fund it.  In recent years, however, companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic have begun to commercialise space exploration \u2013 to the tune of $13bn (\u00a38.3bn) over the past decade. These investors might help to realise ambitious ideas like holidays to the moon, lunar mining and trips to Mars \u2013 ideas that could see many ordinary people one day enjoying out-of-this-world experiences. Just last month, a report part-funded by Nasa suggested a permanent Moon base could be finished by the 2030s \u2013 and private investors may help construct it. As the market grows and becomes more relevant to every day consumers, should canny investors be reaching for the stars?  Chad Anderson thinks so. He is managing director of European operations at the Space Angels Network, an investment network which connects potential space investors to the commercial space industry. \u201cSpace is an industry which is yet to be imagined,\u201d he says \u2013 and that means people investing today can actually provide the industry with shape and direction. \u201cIn 2012 we had just 20 angel investors, now that number stands at 60,\u201d says Anderson.  \u201cWe are very much in a gold rush era for space exploration,\u201d says Kevin Cook from the Space Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to raise awareness of all aspects of the space industry.  Some sectors of the space industry are already well established, of course. In fact, we live in a world that has already been transformed by space. The industry is currently worth a staggering $300bn (\u00a3193bn). Most of that money fuels the development of satellites and launchers \u2013 a market that investors in large commercial organisations already recognise as a viable business opportunity, says Anderson.  > If you can dream it, it can happen \u2013 Dylan Taylor, space investor  But while organisations focus on these more secure markets, the rise in private individual investment is helping to fund some of the more unusual space ventures, such as space mining and tourism. Anderson dubs these \u2018black sky\u2019 projects and says the majority of individual investors \u2013 around 80% \u2013 are opting to put their money here. This is something individuals can do, because unlike governments or large companies they have the freedom to invest as they choose.  One of those investors is Dylan Taylor. He has bought a ticket to the edge of space aboard the high altitude balloons now being developed by Arizona-based World View Enterprises. His motivation is simple. \u201cIt\u2019s not about making money, it\u2019s about helping the industry, I want to see it develop,\u201d he says. Among the many companies Taylor has invested in is Colorado-based Golden Spike, the brainchild of planetary scientist Alan Stern. Their objective is to provide private commercial space transportation services to the Moon. \u201cIf you can dream it, it can happen,\u201d adds Taylor. \u201cIt will change the world.\u201d  **Tempting investment**  However, would-be investors should still think carefully before investing in \u2018black sky\u2019 ventures. \u201cIt takes brave individuals, not afraid to lose their jobs, to fund the seed of truly innovative projects,\u201d explains Jose Mariano Lopez. Lopez is relying on those brave individuals, though, to invest in his Barcelona-based company \u2013 Zero2infinity \u2013 which hopes to send fee-paying customers to the edge of space by helium balloons called \u2018bloons\u2019 in the next few years.  Taylor and those like him compare where we are now in terms of \u2018black sky\u2019 space ventures with the internet of the early 1990s. He sees himself as the equivalent of an investor in one of those early online firms. \u201cPeople thought they were nuts at the time,\u201d explains Taylor \u2013 but companies like Amazon and eBay emerged from that period.  Despite the risks, the potential pay-offs make such investments tempting. \u201cI\u2019m of the Peter Thiel school of thought,\u201d explains Anderson, referencing the US entrepreneur who created online payment company Paypal. \u201cThe way to make a real return on investment is to either do something that is technically 10 times better than what\u2019s already on the market, or do something completely new.\u201d Think SpaceX, Google and Facebook: create a new market, and if you succeed, the world is yours.  In fact, some of the more outlandish sectors of the space industry are already generating revenue. Asteroid mining company Planetary Resources is making money through contracts it has agreed with companies and individuals \u2013 even though it will be some time before the firm gets to the asteroids. Founded by Eric Anderson and Peter Diamandis, Planetary Resources\u2019s list of advisers include a veteran Nasa astronaut and James Cameron \u2013 better known as the director of Avatar, the film about planetary moon mining.  > Space will soon be worth 10% of the world\u2019s economy \u2013 Dylan Taylor  Planetary Resources\u2019s message for investors is simple: they believe there is enough economically valuable material in the asteroid belt to redefine wealth on Earth. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even imagine the vastness of resources in our Solar System,\u201d says Anderson. Investment could lead to huge returns \u2013 and an opportunity to support our species as the Earth\u2019s finite resources begin to dwindle, he adds.  The promise of human spaceflight is another area of interest for individual investors \u2013 although exactly how wise it is to invest in space tourism and similar ventures isn\u2019t yet clear. These are all completely new markets. It\u2019s true that about 1,000 people have already paid up for tickets on commercial space vehicles, but it is difficult to know whether they are the equivalent of early adopters or whether they actually represent the whole of the market for commercial space travel. \u201cNo-one really knows if there is demand there or not,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the potential yet, but at the same time, that\u2019s what makes it so exciting.\u201d  Of course, as with every form of investment, risk is involved. Fortunes will no doubt be made \u2013 but others will be risked and lost. Some companies will fail. The parallel Taylor draws with the internet boom of the early 90s is relevant: successful companies emerged, but many others went bust. Investors will have to hope that their choices are the right ones.  The economics are still unclear. But Taylor firmly believes there is promising potential. \u201cSpace will soon be worth 10% of the world\u2019s economy,\u201d he says. That figure will come from a combination of today\u2019s tried-and-tested satellites market, the realisation of today\u2019s up-and-coming \u2018black sky\u2019 ideas \u2013 and all manner of other spin-offs not even on the drawing board yet.  For a long time space was about scientists and engineers. \u201cNow you can see the industry growing from that to a legitimate business,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know all the possibilities that can come from space.\u201d  _Follow us_ _on_\u00a0_**Facebook**__, __**Twitter**_, _**Google+**_ and **_LinkedIn_**_._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Rocketing prices: The investors eyeing the riches of space", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150810-rocketing-prices-the-investors-eyeing-the-riches-of-space", "countriesMentioned": ["United States", "Japan", "France"], "author": "Sarah Cruddas"},{"newsText": "Well, that didn\u2019t take long. At the end of last year, it was some anomaly of an ancient Mesoamerican calendar which ramped up irrational concerns that the Universe was out to smite Earth mightily. At the start of this one \u2013 having miraculously emerged from the supposed Maya Armageddon unscathed \u2013 it seems we have dodged another attempt to wipe us out.  Earlier this month, Nasa announced that Apophis \u2013 the \u201cdoomsday asteroid\u201d \u2013 will not hit the Earth in 2036\u2026 which will come as another disappointment of biblical proportions to the doom-sayers and newspaper writers who trumpeted the lump of space rock as the biggest threat to mankind since a misreading of Maya timekeeping.  Nasa\u2019s assessment came as Apophis once again cruised into our cosmic backyard, giving scientists a chance to gather more data so we can better assess the risk. The flybys initially looked like they were good news for headline writers, when the scientists at the European Space Agency managed to determine we had underestimated its size by around 20% \u2013 from 270m (900ft) to 325m (1,000ft) wide. But then Nasa had to go and ruin it all.  But what is puzzling about this cosmic tale is where this lump of rock\u2019s fear factor originates. Apophis may now be far and away the most famous threat to life as we know it, but it\u2019s far from the only one. According to recent Nasa estimates it is just one of some 4,700 PHAs: potentially hazardous asteroids that are a minimum of 100m (300ft) in width, are big enough to level a city, and which have orbits that bring them within 8m km (5m miles) of Earth. And, to be absolutely clear, that\u2019s 4,700 PHAs, not 47,000 as reported by various newspapers and scores of other innumerate websites.  Even with its recent super-sizing, Apophis isn\u2019t among the larger PHAs on the list, and it\u2019s not due to enter our immediate neighbourhood until 2029 (this time around it came no nearer than 14 million kilometres). So why does it grab the headlines, rather than 1999 AN10, which is expected to get closer to us than the Moon in 2027; or the almost one-kilometre-wide 2001 WN5, due to get even closer the following year, or perhaps 2012 DA14, which will come within 35,000 kilometres (22,000 miles) of Earth on 15 February. That\u2019s 15 February 2013.  I just thought I\u2019d slip that one in. Yes, depending on when you\u2019re reading this we are only days away from a 130,000-tonne asteroid \u2013 massive enough to cause an explosion hundreds of times more powerful than an atom bomb \u2013 passing close enough to us to hit orbiting satellites. And yet there\u2019s been far less fuss about 2012 DA14 than the much more distant threat from Apophis.  I suspect that Apophis\u2019 apocalyptic appeal comes in part because of a comsic alignment that meant it was initially thought to be most likely to impact on a Friday 13th. It was also given the name 99942 Apophis. Which scarily sounds like a cross between Apocalypse and prophecy, and according to most media reports derives from an equally scary Egyptian god of destruction or chaos. In fact, two of the asteroid\u2019s co-discoverers Roy Tucker and David Tholen are fans of the TV series Stargate SG-1, and they say they named it after one of the show\u2019s recurring villains. But that would ruin the story wouldn\u2019t it?  **Capricious cosmos**  Yet, it can\u2019t all be down to the lack of a catchy name. And it isn\u2019t. Although as far as I can tell it\u2019s the only such asteroid to even have a proper name. It\u2019s more the continuing aftershock from when it first smashed into the mainstream media at the end of 2004.  For just a few panicky days Apophis became the first and so far only near- Earth object to reach four on the Torino scale of impact hazards, where zero equals next to no risk and 10 means that a collision is certain with something big enough to threaten the planet. Even that four rating translates as Apophis being more than 97% likely to miss the Earth.  Further observations got that rating drastically downgraded within the week but by then Apophis had been splashed all over the media and become embedded in our cultural consciousness as the \u201cdoomsday asteroid\u201d.\u00a0 It has had numerous name checks in poem and song \u2013 notably in The Profits of Doom by goth metal outfit Type O Negative (aka \u201cThe Drab Four\u201d), which mentions Friday 13th 2029 and how \u201cthis stone\u2019s called Apophis; it brings Apocalypse\u201d. Even more impressively, it\u2019s the jumping-off point for 2011 video game Rage, which unfolds in the aftermath of global devastation initiated by a collision with Apophis.  What may also have contributed to our willingness to get into such a lather is that it hit the headlines only a few years after the Earth-imperilled-by- asteroid blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact hit multiplexes, giving us further cause to watch the skies. Apophis fitted with what we\u2019d learned from the movies \u2013 that we are at the mercy of a capricious cosmos \u2013 so it became a focus of fear.  Now, thanks to observations made during its 2013 intersections with our orbit, Apophis is a big fat zero on the Torino scale for all 19 of its Earth fly-bys over the next century. So too are all but one of the hundreds of other Near Earth Objects that Nasa gives a rating to. Even the exception \u2013 2007 VK184 \u2013 only scores one because there is an estimated teeny tiny chance (one in 1,820) that it could hit us on 3 June 2048. Probably not worth putting in your forward planner, then.  So, there appears to be no real cause for alarm about any of the many, many chunks of space rock we know of that are out there. But, if you do want something to worry about then bear in mind that \u2013 with apologies to Hamlet \u2013 there are more things in the heavens and potentially headed to Earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy. Last year, 2012 LZ1 \u2013 an asteroid three times bigger than Apophis \u2013 was only spotted for the first time four days before its closest approach to Earth. Who\u2019s to say that next time we might have even less notice about something headed straight for us?  _Do you agree with Quentin? Do you have your own theories?

The supposedly sizeable strip of land, named Sandy Island on Google maps, was positioned midway between Australia and French-governed New Caledonia.  But when scientists from the University of Sydney went to the area, they found only the blue ocean of the Coral Sea.  The phantom island has featured in publications for at least a decade.  Scientist Maria Seton, who was on the ship, said that the team was expecting land, not 1,400m (4,620ft) of deep ocean.  \"We wanted to check it out because the navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400m in that area - very deep,\" Dr Seton, from the University of Sydney, told the AFP news agency after the 25-day voyage.  \"It's on Google Earth and other maps so we went to check and there was no island.

Australia's Hydrographic Service, which produces the country's nautical charts, says its appearance on some scientific maps and Google Earth could just be the result of human error, repeated down the years.  A spokesman from the service told Australian newspapers that while some map makers intentionally include phantom streets to prevent copyright infringements, that was was not usually the case with nautical charts because it would reduce confidence in them.  A spokesman for Google said they consult a variety of authoritative sources when making their maps.  \"The world is a constantly changing place, the Google spokesman told AFP, \"and keeping on top of these changes is a never-ending endeavour'.'

It's not a lander or a rover, but a submarine \u2013 a vehicle with an instantly recognisable torpedo shape. But unlike any other submarine, this one is designed to explore the depths of extraterrestrial seas.  The destination is Titan, Saturn\u2019s largest moon and the only other place in the Solar System with lots of liquid pooling on its surface. While Earth\u2019s seas are water, Titan\u2019s are filled with a mixture of methane and ethane \u2013 stuff that\u2019s normally a gas on a warmer Earth. Titan is so cold \u2013 about -180C (-292F) \u2013 that these compounds are in liquid form, creating wet environments that could maybe, just maybe, harbour life.  The prime candidates for alien abodes would be Titan\u2019s several dozen lakes and seas, the biggest being Kraken Mare. No one is quite sure how deep it is, but it likely plunges for hundreds of metres and spans as much as 400,000 square km \u2013 five times larger than Lake Superior in North America. And it\u2019s where scientists want to send the Titan sub.  It\u2019s unlikely that we will find alien fish swimming in Kraken Mare. But there could be microorganisms. In its hunt for habitability, the submarine would be diving into uncharted waters (or, rather, methane), exploring an alien world in a completely different way.  The first and only spacecraft to land on Titan was the European Huygens probe, which, during its descent in 2005, gathered data on the atmosphere and clouds. It snapped the first pictures of the surface. For more than a decade, Nasa\u2019s Cassini spacecraft has been studying the Saturnian system and Titan, probing its seas with radar and collecting basic data about the liquid surface. But their depths remain unexplored.  > The prime candidates for alien abodes would be Titan\u2019s several dozen lakes and seas, the biggest being Kraken Mare  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what else is in there,\u201d says Steve Oleson, an engineer at Nasa\u2019s Glenn Research Center who\u2019s leading the sub\u2019s design effort. \u201cWe could send a boat, but think about when people first explored our oceans. They had no idea what\u2019s beneath the surface.\u201d  The submarine is still just a concept. Last year, researchers finished the first stage of designing what such a vehicle might look like. So far, they\u2019ve come up with a six-metre-long vessel that would spend 90 days traversing 3,000 kilometres of Kraken Mare, cruising at an average speed of just 1km/h. But that ability to explore many locations and environments is a submarine\u2019s big advantage. The Mars Opportunity rover, in contrast, has gone fewer than 45km \u2013 and it\u2019s been operating for 12 years.  The sub would survey the sediments that settled on the sea floor, and sample how the chemistry of the sea may be changing with depth. It would study the weather and the shorelines, searching for signs of sea level change and clues about Titan\u2019s climate history. It would probe the chemistry and geology of a world that, in certain ways, is more similar to Earth than any other place in the Solar System.  > Titan and Earth are the only two Solar-System worlds where rain falls onto the surface  Titan and Earth are the only two Solar-System worlds where rain (albeit methane rain for Titan) falls onto the surface, filling lakes and seas that are connected by rivers and tributaries. Unlike, for example, Mars\u2019s wispy atmosphere or Venus\u2019s crushingly thick layers of gas, Titan\u2019s atmospheric pressure is only about one-and-a-half times greater than Earth's at sea level.  \u201cIt\u2019s basically the same as the bottom of a municipal swimming pool,\u201d says Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University and the leading scientist of the project. \u201cIn principle, a human being could walk around on the surface of Titan with a very thick parka and an oxygen mask.\u201d  But what lies beneath is especially tantalising. Life as we know it requires liquid water, and scientists think you need some sort of liquid \u2013 like liquid methane \u2013 to coax life into existence.  \u201cAs to whether this could work or not, this is one of those problems where no amount of thinking and doing theory is going to solve,\u201d says Jason Barnes, a planetary scientist at the University of Idaho who isn\u2019t involved with the Titan submarine project. \u201cWe need to go there and make the measurements and do the experiments to find out.\u201d  One way is to search for life-affirming chemical patterns. For example, the molecular building blocks of proteins, called amino acids, have structures that can be mirror images of each other. An amino acid can be left- or right- handed, Lorenz explains, and those associated with life on Earth all happen to be right-handed. The hypothesis is that any organisms in Titan seas would\u2019ve evolved one or the other, and finding a preponderance of right- or left-handed amino acids could suggest life, Lorenz says.  > The researchers envision putting the sub onboard a mini space shuttle like the Boeing X-37 space plane  The plan is for the submarine to explore Titan alone. But researchers may consider sending an orbiter to relay data and communications back to Earth. The team also needs to flesh out how the sub will get there. For now, they envision putting the sub onboard a mini space shuttle like the Boeing X-37 space plane. Titan\u2019s atmosphere is thick enough that the craft can glide down onto Kraken Mare. It\u2019ll then submerge while releasing the floating sub.  And there are still engineering challenges. For example, nitrogen is dissolved in the seas, like the carbon dioxide in a can of Coke. The concern is that the warmth from the submarine\u2019s radioactive-isotope power supply will cause the nitrogen to fizz. \u201cIf it bubbles even a little bit, the bubbles can build up and interfere with our science,\u201d Oleson says.  Oceans of the Solar System  The hunt for oceans in space marks the beginning of a new search for life in our solar system.

A young woman cradles her newborn while an anxious new father looks on. \"Manic depression, 42% probability. Attention hyper-deficit disorder, 89% probability. Heart disorder, 99% probability... life expectancy 30.2 years.\"  The scene is from the 1997 sci-fi classic Gattaca, in which a man refuses to accept the rules of a future society condemning him to an underclass only fit for menial work because of his less-than-perfect genetic inheritance. Back in early 21st Century reality, gene tests don\u2019t yet feature in job interviews, thankfully. Yet the idea that the code of life within us \u2013 DNA \u2013 can predict our long-term health prospects from the moment of birth is a powerful and persuasive one.  Since the mid-2000s several companies have launched tests for the general public, offering consumers cheap, simple genetic screening for a wide range of health conditions. Spit into a tube or take a sample with a cheek swab, send it off for testing and for as little as $99 you could receive in return information ranging from ancestral links to risks of specific diseases, according to the manufacturers.  But all has not been plain sailing for this nascent personal gene testing industry. In 2012, two of the three big players, decodeMe and Navigenics, pulled out of the market after being acquired by other companies. And in November last year, the third and arguably most high-profile company, 23andMe, which says it has more than half a million customers, stopped offering new tests after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had failed to show its health predictions were accurate.  \"That evidence is simply not available, so I would not be surprised if this marks the end of direct-to-consumer genetic testing for most common diseases,\" says epidemiologist Cecile Janssens, of Emory University, in Atlanta, Georgia.  If this is the case, then why do DNA tests sold to consumers appear to be as unreliable as US regulators say? And if these tests can't be trusted, where does that leave the broader hopes that our newfound ability to read our individual genetic code can help us live longer, healthier lives?  **Screen test**  Doubts about whether the industry could deliver what it promised surfaced early. In 2008, for example, I submitted samples of my DNA to three companies as part of an investigation for the Sunday Times newspaper. While deCODEme informed me my risk of developing exfoliation glaucoma, which causes loss of vision, was 91% below average, 23andMe said I was 3.6 times more likely than average to get it. British company GeneticHealth said I had four times the average risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by my late 80s, while deCODEme described the risk as 74% above average. I was given conflicting predictions for other conditions including age-related macular degeneration, Crohn's disease and hypertension.  I wasn\u2019t the only one. In 2009, pioneering human genome sequencer Craig Venter and several colleagues sent samples to 23andMe and Navigenics, and also received similarly contradictory results.  Critics have argued that without guidance people are liable to misinterpret their results, potentially leading to them feeling either unnecessarily alarmed or falsely reassured.  \"What if a woman who learns she does not have the BRCA1 or 2 mutations that make her at high risk of breast cancer decides she will no longer go for her mammograms, even though for the average American woman not having them only cuts the risk from around 12% to 11.95%?\" says Hank Greely, Director of Stanford University's Center for Law and the Biosciences.  Others respond that people have the right to their genetic data, and that access to it can improve health prospects and even save lives. Last year, Robert Green and colleagues from Harvard Medical School completed a survey of 1,800 customers who had bought direct-to-consumer genetic tests. Although the results haven't yet been published, he says preliminary findings suggest that around four in 10 claim the tests motivated them to make changes such as improving their diet and doing more exercise, while only 1% reported altering prescription treatment without consulting a doctor.  \"It's certainly an industry that should be carefully examined and potentially regulated,\" says Green, who set out his case against the FDA's decision in the journal Nature earlier this month. \"But the emerging evidence suggests that sometimes people use their results to motivate lifestyle changes,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a very few cases individuals and their relatives have learnt that they were at increased breast and ovarian cancer, and arguably in some of these lives have been saved.\"  It's an interesting clash of perspectives, but one which may be beside the point now that the FDA has slapped a large question mark over the basic accuracy of the test predictions. After being ordered by the FDA to halt its testing service, 23andMe said customers would have access only to its results from ancestry and traits like hair colour, instead of disease risks, while it seeks FDA approval for health-related results.  **Complex influence**  One simple reason genetic tests are limited in their predictive powers is that many common conditions are influenced as much, if not more, by environmental and lifestyle factors than genetic ones. A summary of twin studies published by Emory\u2019s Janssens in 2010 identified that some conditions direct-to-consumer tests offer predictions for are highly heritable, such as type 1 diabetes at 88%, schizophrenia at 81% and Alzheimer's disease at 79%, but that most have low-to-moderate heritability, such as prostate cancer at 42%, depression 37% and type 2 diabetes 26%. \"There is no utility at all in doing a genetic test for a disease with low heritability,\" says Janssens.  Even if a disease is highly heritable, that does not necessarily mean DNA tests can make an accurate prediction of risks. For many conditions, scientists have found that large numbers of genes may have small effects, and the way these interact with each other and non-genetic causes such as smoking, diet and physical activity levels is far too complicated for the simple models used by the tests to untangle. \"In most common diseases such as type 2 diabetes or heart disease, there are many risk factors, both genetic and non- genetic, that play a role,\" says Janssens. \"These can interact in unique and complex ways in different people, and it's difficult to capture this complexity in a model.\"  This view is supported by research carried out by John Burn, Professor of Clinical Genetics at Newcastle University, who looked into the effects of six genes on the risks of babies born with spina bifida. \"The effects of these variants didn't just add together in a simple way,\" says Burn. \"There were some situations where a variant was a disadvantage unless it was in the presence of another variant when it became an advantage. Companies that have been offering genetic tests for common diseases imply they understand these relationships but in fact they grossly underestimate their immense complexity.\"  On top of these problems many cases of the disease-associated markers (or SNPs as they are known) discovered so far only account for a small part of the known heritability of those conditions, and there is little consensus about why this might be. \"The case of the missing heritability is the biggest issue right now in human genetics,\" says Greely.  In research published last summer, Janssens and colleagues found variations in the predictions produced by 23andMe, deCODEme and Navigenics were due in part to them using widely different numbers of SNPs for the same conditions, and sometimes using drastically different average disease risks. For coeliac disease, for example, deCODEme had an average population risk of 1% \u2013 eight times higher than that used by 23andMe and 16 times higher than Navigenics. Variations in the disease predictions provided for individuals therefore might be more to do with which company they decide to do their tests with than their genes.****  The health risk reports 23andMe provides for its users do acknowledge the role of environmental factors in disease susceptibility and also state the information provided \"is intended for research and educational purposes only, and is not for diagnostic use\". However in its November letter to the company, the FDA made it clear it is now among those who see this disclaimer as disingenuous when sitting alongside statements such as the health reports being a \"first step in prevention\" enabling users to \"take steps toward mitigating serious diseases\".  **Risk assessment**  The question is whether more advanced genetic tests will provide a clearer picture. Direct-to-consumer genetic tests, and other types of DNA analysis, use \"SNP chips\" which can identify up to one million genetic variants. New techniques mean that reading all six billion bases of the human genome \u2013 known as whole genome sequencing (WGS) \u2013 is getting cheaper and quicker. The current cost is around $5,000. Some predict that once this drops to around $1,000, it won't be long before everyone has their genomes sequenced. In December British Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for the country to become the first in the world to routinely sequence everyone's genomes at birth.  \"I think we're moving from a SNP world where the associations are weak and questionable, to a whole genome world where there will be more strong and clinically valid associations,\" says Greely. \"For the common diseases for which the known genetic contribution to heritability is limited, whole genome sequencing isn't going to make any difference, but it could do for the thousands of rare monogenic diseases as well as in other non-rare conditions for which there are strong associations like Alzheimer's. That may mean the medical implications are not enormous for most of us, he says, \u201cbut if it gets cheap enough I suspect that good healthcare systems will get whole genome sequences on their patients in another 10 years or so.\"  Sequencing everyone's genomes could improve existing disease screening programmes such as those for breast and bowel cancer. Those identified as being at a greater genetic risk could be tested more frequently and at an earlier age, while those at lower risk could be tested less often, making it possible to pick up illness sooner and save money. \"We might, for example, give all women a cancer predisposition test at the age of 30,\" says Burn.  Another benefit of universal DNA analysis is likely to be significant reductions in children born with rare \"recessive\" disorders, which only occur when a child inherits malfunctioning genetic variants from both their mother and father. These illnesses often come as a complete surprise to the families concerned because those who carry just one copy of the genetic abnormality are \"carriers\" but do not show any sign of ill health. About one in 25 Caucasians of northern European descent carries the gene variant for cystic fibrosis and around one in 12 African-Americans is a carrier of sickle cell anemia, for instance. In a world in which we all know our carrier status, couples who know their unborn offspring are at risk could undergo IVF and select embryos without these conditions.  With more and more people seeking to find information about their reproductive risks before or during pregnancy, many are deciding not to wait for the advent of widespread genome sequencing. The market for \"carrier screening\" has been growing rapidly in recent years, especially in the US. San Francisco-based company Counsyl, for example, sells tests that look for some 400 mutations and that cause around 100 genetic disorders for $599.  Non-invasive prenatal DNA tests involving obtaining foetal DNA from pregnant women's blood are also gaining in popularity. These are safer and do not carry the risk of miscarriage that come with traditional screening methods such as amniocentesis. They are currently being used for detecting Down\u2019s syndrome and for early sex detection of X-linked diseases like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and haemophilia, however they have the potential to be used for many more conditions in future.  Both science fiction such as the film Gattaca and current problems faced by 23andMe et al provide important warnings about the dangers of overly simplistic approaches to genetics. These are valuable lessons, however they shouldn't detract from the dramatic impact this is already having on the quality and length of many human lives, and its potential to power improvements for even more of us in the future.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Can we ever fully trust personal gene tests?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140129-personal-gene-tests-what-next", "countriesMentioned": ["Georgia", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada"], "author": "Nic Fleming"},{"newsText": "The US Navy has a problem. Its ships often stay at sea for months on end far away from home. To keep its fleet of ships, boats and aircraft running, a fleet of 15 oil tankers roams the globe acting like floating gas stations. According to the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) nearly 600 million gallons (2,700 million litres) of fuel were delivered to Navy vessels in 2011.  Moving those tanks of oil is an expensive business and that is even before the cost of the oil itself is factored in. Over recent years, the price of oil has fluctuated wildly, but has generally been on an upward trend. Throw in the fact that many of the large oil-producing nations are generally situated in volatile regions of the world, and you begin to understand why the Navy is interested in cutting its dependence on oil.  One of the most interesting lines it is pursuing is a plan to generate jet fuel from a source that is abundance wherever the fleet is: seawater.  Jet fuel, along with all other common fuels, is a hydrocarbon. As the name suggests, these are chains of hydrogen and carbon atoms. In theory if you can combine those two elements in the correct way you can produce a fuel.\u00a0 It turns out that seawater is a good source of both ingredients \u2013 it contains hydrogen in the H20, and a lot of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2). It also has the advantage of occurring in abundance - and for the Navy - close to the action.  \u201cThe ocean contains about 100mg per litre of CO2,\u201d explains the NRL\u2019s Dr Heather Willauer. \u201cIt\u2019s about 140 times more concentrated in sea water than it is in the air.\u201d  Dr Willauer has developed a machine to grab those raw ingredients directly from sea. \u201cWe have an electrochemical unit. We feed it seawater, we acidify the seawater, and what comes out of the cell is oxygen, CO2, and hydrogen,\u201d she says.  The oxygen is released, and the other two gasses are combined to make a liquid fuel.  \u201cYou take those components (CO2 and hydrogen), and use a catalytic process, for a gas to liquid type reaction,\u201d she adds. The basics are similar to the descriptions of a process for converting water and air into petrol, that grabbed headlines last week.  If both sound too good to be true, then you would be right. There is a catch. According to the first law of thermodynamics, nothing comes for free. To get useful energy out, you need to put useful energy in to the system. It is like combustion in reverse. Energy is needed to break the water and the carbon dioxide down into constituent parts and then more energy \u2013 and time \u2013 is needed to form the hydrocarbon.  \u201cWe do have to have a power source to supply the electricity for the electrochemical process,\u201d admits Dr Willauer. That could come from solar or \u2013 more likely - the nuclear reactors already onboard many ships.  The system would also only have marginal environmental benefits. It would reduce the burden of moving fuel around, but that may be offset by the production process. And, in the end, it would still produce traditional fuel with its associated emissions when burnt.\u00a0 For the Navy, this is more about convenience.  **\u2018Chicken power\u2019**  At the moment a 1.5mx1.5m (5ftx5ft) prototype is installed onshore at an NRL engineering facility in Key West, Florida. It has been using seawater from the Gulf of Mexico to test the conversion process and is now focused on optimising the technology and scaling it up. They are also beginning to think about the engineering challenges of putting a system to sea.  \u201cBecause we are developing technologies to potentially be used by the Navy, that goes into the technology when we develop it,\u201d says Dr Willauer. \u201cWe want to make sure it has as small a footprint, and a small a size as possible, and keep those constraints in mind.\u201d  The team is also willing to stick its neck out and predict a cost for jet fuel produced by the process of $3 to $6 per gallon.  If they were able to keep to that cost \u2013 and there are plenty of people who think that the real cost would be much higher \u2013 it would give it the edge over another fuel the Navy is currently experimenting with.  Earlier this summer, the Navy ran its first large-scale exercise fuelled by a $12m blend of biofuels produced from everything from chicken bones to algae. The Pacific demonstration was part of a project known as Great Green Fleet. During the manoeuvres, F/A-18 Super Hornets and other aircraft screamed off the flight deck of the USS Nimitz over the Pacific Ocean powered by conventional jet fuel mixed with the biofuels. Two destroyers and a cruiser also ploughed the oceans fuelled by a similar mix.  All went well with the exercise, until the costs came in. The biofuel mix cost around $26 per gallon ($6 per litre), significantly more than the $3.50 per gallon ($1 per litre) paid for regular fuel. Critics pointed out that the Navy\u2019s job was defending the US, not helping the emerging biofuel industry bring down its costs, a point that has been compounded by looming defence cuts. For now, the Navy is continuing with its vision and has reiterated its commitment to have half of its fleet powered by alternative energy sources by 2020.  But don\u2019t expect that fleet to be accompanied by refueling ships, sucking in seawater. That research is far behind the biofuel work. It will take six to eight years for the NRL to fully develop the seawater idea, depending on funding. And then it will take many more years to build working systems. By then, the Great Green Fleet may have already sailed.  _If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our _Facebook page_ or message us on _Twitter_._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Turning the oceans into jetfuel", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121019-turning-the-oceans-into-jetfuel", "countriesMentioned": ["Mexico", "United States", "Puerto Rico", "Argentina", "Uruguay"], "author": "Jon Stewart"},{"newsText": "One hundred years after Sir Ernest Shackleton stepped foot on South Georgia \u2013 an island that had never been mapped \u2013 Google has brought the isolated region into people\u2019s homes, adding the subantarctic isle and the neighbouring Falkland Islands to its arsenal of Street View imagery.

Zenimax Media, owner of renowned games studio id Software, is suing Facebook for $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).  Zenimax argued its early innovations in VR were unlawfully copied when Oculus built its own headset, the Rift.  Oculus was bought by Facebook in 2014, and is seen as a major part of the firm\u2019s strategy over the next 10 years.  The BBC understands Mr Zuckerberg will argue that Zenimax was slow to appreciate the potential of VR - and that it was Oculus\u2019 own work that made it the valuable technology it is today.  \"We're eager to present our case in court,\u201d a spokesman for Oculus told the BBC.  \"Oculus and its founders have invested a wealth of time and money in VR because we believe it can fundamentally transform the way people interact and communicate.  \"We're disappointed that another company is using wasteful litigation to attempt to take credit for technology that it did not have the vision, expertise, or patience to build.\u201d  **Carmack**  The row revolves around John Carmack, the legendary games designer famed for titles such as Doom and Quake. The company he co-founded, id Software, is owned by Zenimax.  For a short time, Mr Carmack was working for both id and Oculus - but in November 2013 he left id completely.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption John Carmack is accused of taking intellectual property with him after he left id Software  \"When it became clear that I wasn't going to have the opportunity to do any work on VR while at id Software, I decided to not renew my contract,\u201d he told USA Today in 2014.  Zenimax now alleges that Mr Carmack shared intellectual property with Oculus while he was still working at id Software, and that when he left the company, he took that work with him.  According to court papers: \"Carmack secretly and illegally copied thousands of documents containing ZeniMax's intellectual property from his computer at ZeniMax to a USB storage device which he wrongfully took with him to Oculus.\"  Speaking at the trial, which began last week, Zenimax lawyer Tony Sammi said it amounted to \"one of the biggest technology heists ever\u201d.  But lawyers for Mr Carmack characterised it differently, arguing that his contract explicitly allowed him to work with other companies that did not compete with Zenimax.  They argued that the \"trade secrets\" Zenimax claimed to have lost were in fact \"the fruits of Mr. Carmack's participation and involvement with Palmer Luckey and Oculus\", and therefore did not belong to Zenimax.  **Missed the boat**  Facebook\u2019s defence is that Zenimax had its chance to invest in VR but chose not to - giving Oculus no option other than to seek outside investment.  The social media giant is arguing that Zenimax only showed significant interest in virtual reality after its $2bn acquisition was made public.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey has not appeared in public since revelations he was funding a pro-Trump online campaign  Also crucial to the case is Palmer Luckey. Mr Luckey - who hasn\u2019t been seen in public since revelations he was funding an online trolling campaign in support of Donald Trump \\- is expected to be called to the stand at some point this week.  In court papers Zenimax paints Mr Luckey as a \u201cgaming enthusiast\u201d whose Oculus Rift headset, which was initially funded via Kickstarter, was a crude prototype.  Mr Luckey, Zenimax said, lacked \"the necessary expertise and technical know- how to create a viable virtual reality headset\u201d, and therefore relied on Zenimax to help him create the prototype which impressed Facebook.  Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance is expected to last most of the day on Tuesday.  On Monday, the 32-year-old posted about meeting with local communities and law enforcement groups in Dallas as part of his new year pledge to travel to 30 different US states in 2017.  **_Follow Dave Lee _**on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC**_ and _**on Facebook", "newsHeadline": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg due in court over VR 'heist' - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38646410", "countriesMentioned": ["United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "If you visit someone with a newborn baby, their description of the pain of childbirth often includes the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d.\u00a0 One friend even begged me to dissuade her if she ever suggested having a second child in the future. Yet a few years later there she was, approaching the due date for the next baby.  The explanation usually given is that women simply forget exactly what the pain was like because the brain edits out the memory. In evolutionary terms it might make sense to forget the pain of childbirth in case it deterred people from reproduction. But unfortunately it seems not to be that simple.  On the subject of childbirth, for instance, a review of studies conducted before 2000, concluded that women do not completely forget labour pain \u2013 or the intensity of the pain they experienced. It\u2019s a difficult topic to study, though. There are scales that allow people to rate their experience of pain, but since childbirth tends to take many hours, it\u2019s not always clear which part of labour or childbirth study participants focus on. Even individual contractions vary in their painfulness, so scoring the pain of the whole experience is never going to be easy.  What you can do, though, is examine whether individual women\u2019s recollections of their pain change with time. A Swedish study took more than 2,000 mothers and compared ratings of their memories of the pain and experience of childbirth two months after the birth with their ratings 12 months later.  Again, the evidence suggests that most women don\u2019t forget: the memory of the experience of childbirth was the same for 60% of the women at two months and 12 months. In fact, just one-third of the mothers at 12 months had forgotten quite how painful they\u2019d considered childbirth at two months. And for 18% the opposite happened \u2013 far from forgetting the pain, in their minds the experience had become more painful by 12 months.  **Rewriting the past**  Five years later, the researchers talked to the women again. By now, the memory of labour pain had indeed declined in some women \u2013 about half of them rated the pain as less severe than they had done at two months \u2013 but for those who had rated the experience most negatively after two months, the memory of the pain simply didn\u2019t go away. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, though. Some studies have found that women who remember the pain of childbirth see coping with the experience as an achievement that stays with them. \u201cIf I can cope with labour pain I can cope with anything.\u201d  But it still might come as a surprise that the memory of pain often remains unchanged with time. That\u2019s because decades of psychological research on memory show that we reconstruct memories slightly differently every time we recall them. Our memories are not like a DVD library which we can browse through, replaying any past event exactly as it happened \u2013 instead, the context of the original memory and the way we tell the story each time makes a difference. The pain of childbirth is pain with a purpose \u2013 provided the baby is delivered safely, this positive result should, in theory, lessen the memory of the pain. But clearly, for some mothers even the happy event of a new-born baby can\u2019t diminish the painful memory of childbirth.  So if the intensity of this kind of \u201cpositive\u201d pain isn\u2019t necessarily forgotten, how about more negative experiences?  Sometimes it\u2019s important that we feel some pain and remember what caused it \u2013 the memory can keep us safe and prevent an accident from happening again. A painful cut gained when opening a tin can, for instance, will generally ensure that you are more careful the next time you\u2019re preparing dinner. Or if, like me, you find yourself wondering whether the metal ring around a fire pit gets really hot and you touch it with all four fingers, you probably won\u2019t do that again. Sadly that was aged 30, not aged five. As you might expect, then, people with disorders which prevent them from feeling pain at all frequently burn and injure themselves. So we don\u2019t necessarily want to forget all pain.  Forgetting some pain might be useful, though \u2013 particularly the chronic pain sometimes associated with conditions like diabetes. Clues to controlling and eliminating this sort of pain at the molecular level come from recent work.  Just walking past the doorway where you stubbed your toe, or using the door you once shut your finger in, can make you wince at the memory. In 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona College of Medicine claimed this is because of a molecule called PKMzeta, which they argued strengthens the connections between neurons in the brain when we learn something new \u2013 and also creates physical sensitivity after a painful experience. Using mice, they demonstrated that, if they blocked this specific molecule in the spine, they could erase the extra sensitivity to pain in the mice. However, other researchers have since questioned this finding, showing that mice born without PKMzeta could still feel pain.  What about the uncomfortable or traumatic pain that can be associated with some medical procedures? When colonoscopies are done under conscious sedation, patients are sometimes given a drug called midazolam which makes them feel less anxious and also promotes anterograde amnesia \u2013 the inability to form new memories. Patients might wince or wriggle with discomfort during the procedure, but the hope is that they won\u2019t remember any pain or feel disturbed by the procedure afterwards.  **Lingering feelings**  Some have questioned the ethics of this approach \u2013 and its implications. In a paper published last year Andrew Davidson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital in Victoria, Australia, warned that although drugs such as midazolam can make it harder to form conscious memories, they can leave implicit memories intact. These are memories that affect us even though we can\u2019t consciously recall them. So we can button a shirt or find our way along a familiar route to the station without thinking about when we actually made those memories. Troublingly, Davidson suggests that even if you don't remember a colonoscopy, you might feel \u201cstrangely uncomfortable when walking past a garden hose\u201d. Would it be more ethical if patients were warned in advance that this might happen?  It\u2019s even been suggested that to mitigate the psychological trauma of the very rare situations where patients wake up while under a general anaesthetic, they could be given midazolam as soon as the anaesthetist realises, to disrupt the formation of memories of the event. But this would only erase memories from the point when the drug was administered, not from the point of waking.  The ethics of the use of drugs like this will continue to be discussed. The very fact that they are being considered underlines the fact that \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 for people who have given birth or experienced other kinds of agony, it can be a myth that pain has no memory.  _Share this story on __Facebook__, __Google+__ or __Twitter__._  Update: This article has been amended to reflect the evidence questioning the importance of the molecule PKMzeta.    > Even if you don't remember a colonoscopy, you might feel strangely uncomfortable when walking past a garden hose", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Why painful memories linger with us", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150311-can-we-edit-out-painful-memories", "countriesMentioned": ["Australia", "United States", "Canada", "Seychelles", "United Kingdom", "Malta", "Romania", "Malaysia", "Mexico", "Chile", "Argentina", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Panama"], "author": "Claudia Hammond"},{"newsText": "When Piero Genovesi received my email, his interest was piqued.

Still, he was intrigued enough to investigate.  The reason it\u2019s a tricky question is because invaded lands vastly outnumber the places still untouched. Where humans go, invasive species tend to follow, Genovesi says, and \u201cthere is literally no island in the world that has had no contact with humans in the last century\u201d.  We\u2019ve taxied invasive species around the globe for millennia. Some of the earliest mammal invasions occurred 8,000 to 9,000 years ago, when Neolithic humans introduced wild boars to Sicily and shrews to Cyprus, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. In AD77, Pliny the Elder penned the oldest written evidence of invasive species\u2019 impacts, writing in his Naturalis Historia that rabbits were causing famines on the Balearic Islands, which forced desperate residents to start throwing ferrets into the rabbit burrows as a means of controlling those insatiable pests.  **Passenger aliens**  Far from something confined to history, however, detrimental species introductions continue to happen frequently today, from egg-hungry Argentine black and white tegus taking up residence in Florida, to a sudden influx of exotic crazy ants in Texas. Invasive species have been implicated in more than half of recent extinctions and they ring up more than $120bn in annual damages in the US alone.  Some of these stowaways are inadvertent passengers \u2013 the rats, roaches and other pests that we ourselves cannot manage to contain. Others are intentionally introduced, whether for food, as pets or in an ill-devised attempt to control another species that we want to get rid of.  Despite their ubiquity, however, Genovesi figured that places free from invasive species must exist, even if he was not aware of them himself. So he submitted the question to the \u201cAliens-list,\u201d a professional listserve whose 1,000-plus members make up the world\u2019s invasive species management frontline. Putting their collective knowledge to use, they came up with a few examples of places that are most likely free of invasive species.  Not surprisingly, only the most remote and extreme ecosystems have managed to exclude invaders. Thermophilic bacteria \u2013 the kinds that flourish in environments subjected to excessive heat \u2013 likely live free from invaders. Such spots include the hot springs of Yellowstone and Iceland, the edges of deep sea geothermal vents and some volcanic soil. Extremely dry areas, such as the Arabian Desert, also have few if any non-native species. The open ocean\u2019s pelagic zone \u2013 the layer of water located between the surface and the sea floor \u2013 is usually alien-free as well, as is the deep sea. Caves also tend to escape invasion, although the fungus that causes the deadly white-nose disease in bats is increasingly turning up in those habitats, especially in the US.  Historically, the polar areas largely escaped the presence of invasive species. But concerns are growing that the situation is already beginning to change thanks to an increasing number of tourists, scientists and adventurers visiting those regions, as well as the lessening extremity of those environments, because of climate change. Researchers in Svalbard, an archipelago located in the Arctic Circle, found more than 1,000 seeds from 53 species of alien plants stuck to the shoes of visitors arriving over a single summer, for example, and dozens of non-native species ranging from moths to flies have been spotted buzzing around research stations in Antarctica. So far, none of the invertebrates seem to have permanently established itself on the Antarctic continent, but scientists fear it\u2019s only a matter of time. The nearby South Georgia Island, for example, has already succumbed to that fate: invasive beetles are chomping their way through native ones, and rats and introduced reindeer threaten seabird populations there.  One notable exception to the where-there\u2019s-humans-there\u2019s-invasive-species rule are remote tracts of rainforest. Few if any alien species live deep within the Amazon or in Borneo, despite the presence of people living there. But that\u2019s because those isolated tribes don\u2019t come into contact with potential invaders themselves. Typically, even the remotest places \u2013 Gough Island in the South Atlantic, Palmyra Atoll in the Pacific \u2013 contain the living relics of humans\u2019 time there. Rats alone have reached at least 90% of the world\u2019s islands thanks to our movements.  **Sign of hope**  Yet could any invaded ecosystems eventually rejoin this list of pristine places? If what\u2019s been happening over the past few years in New Zealand offers any clues, then there\u2019s some cause for optimism.  As a country largely free from endemic mammals, New Zealand \u2013 the last large islands in the world to be settled by humans \u2013 is particularly vulnerable to the effects of warm-blooded creatures. It started with the first Polynesian settlers, and later with Europeans. \u201cNew Zealand was a place of birds,\u201d says Nick Holmes, director of science at Island Conservation, a non-profit organisation that specialises in invasive species eradication. \u201cThe only native mammals there were bats and marine mammals.\u201d  Today, however, New Zealand\u2019s fauna is about evenly divided between native and alien species. Of the country\u2019s approximately 800 islands, less than 1% escaped the arrival of more than 30 alien mammals, including rats, weasels, mice, goats, pigs and brushtail possums. \u201cIn just a few hundred years, the environment has undergone a nearly complete transformation,\u201d says Mick Clout, a conservation biologist at the University of Auckland, and former chair of the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group.  Around 1960, the problems caused by the invaders could no longer be ignored. Species such as the kakapo parrot were quickly disappearing, and possums turned out to be vectors of bovine tuberculosis, causing considerable impacts to the country\u2019s beef industry. At first, New Zealand experts thought that management, not eradication, was the only option available to them. But the late ornithologist Don Merton stumbled upon the discovery that rats could indeed be poisoned out of existence after he distributed Warfarin baits around Maria Island.  For the first time, New Zealanders realised that getting rid of rodent pests for good was a plausible reality. \u201cBasically, no one else could really help because clearing these pests from islands had never been done before,\u201d Clout says. \u201cConservationists here, as opposed to many other places in the world, became very aware that preserving native wildlife and forests unfortunately involved killing things rather than just protecting what we have.\u201d  **Blunt tool**  Efforts began crudely. Acute toxins delivered via ground-based operations did an acceptable job of getting rid of rodents, but the delivery was inefficient and the poisons led to an inhumane end for those creatures. Additionally, some animals received a sub-lethal dose and then learned to avoid the hazardous baits. But the country\u2019s tactics have evolved over time, to the point that other nations began hiring New Zealand contractors to carry out foreign eradications. \u201cWe figured it out by trial and error,\u201d says John Parkes, a retired scientist who freelances as an invasive species consultant. \u201cThe breakthrough for rodents came in the 1980s, when New Zealanders began using brodifacoum baits sown from the air.\u201d  Today, anticoagulant toxins delivered by air are the weapons of choice against island rodents because they take days or even weeks to take effect. That way, all of the rodents receive a toxic dose before realizing that something is amiss. Baits often have up to a 100% success rate for rodents, but other animals such as possums, cats and rabbits usually require on-the-ground teams to eliminate stragglers. Larger animals such as goats and deer, on the other hand, are typically shot, sometimes out of a helicopter. Success rates hover at around 85%.  Thanks to these efforts, around 150 New Zealand islands are now free from invasive mammals. This September, the country celebrates its 50-year anniversary of rodent eradications. As New Zealand gradually works its way up to bigger islands, it even envisions becoming a predator-free country someday. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t have the money, strategy or technology to do that, but we shall see,\u201d says Parkes.  Invasive species eradication teams can now be found in numerous countries around the world (although many still do have some New Zealand involvement). The British recently undertook a massive reindeer, mice and rat eradication effort in South Georgia Island, while the Ecuadorians did the same for goats, pigs and donkeys on two of the islands that make up the Galapagos. More than 1,000 invasive species removals have been carried out to date on islands around the world, and the benefits they deliver to the local environment are usually readily apparent.  On California\u2019s Anacapa Island, for example, invasive rats \u2013 probably stranded there by a 19th Century shipwreck \u2013 were eating their way through vulnerable Scripps\u2019s Murrelet eggs and chicks. In 2002, wildlife managers called in Island Conservation, which has carried out removal operations on 52 islands over the past 20 years, to get rid of the rats. With the vermin soon gone, birds almost immediately began to rebound. The Scripps\u2019s Murrelet population enjoyed a nearly three-fold increase in hatching success, and Anacapa saw its first confirmed endangered Ashy storm-petrel nest. \u201cThe Ashy storm-petrel is this little nocturnal seabird with this beautiful musty smell, but it\u2019s very vulnerable to rats because it breeds on the ground,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cNow that the rats are gone, we\u2019re starting to see the island return back to what it once might have been.\u201d  To date, Australia\u2019s Macquarie Island stands as the largest successful rodent eradication, with an area of about 13,000 hectares cleared of rats and mice, not to mention rabbits. But experts believe that there is an upper limit of the geographic size of an area that can be purged of all invasive species \u2013 even if they haven\u2019t hit that limit yet. Additionally, these extreme undertakings are also very expensive.  So while eradication does often work, experts agree that the most effective means of controlling invasive species is preventing them from arriving in the first place. Some countries do a better job at this than others. The US contains a line on its customs form asking whether visitors have spent time on farms or are bringing any plant or animal materials with them, for example, while New Zealand takes biosecurity to an extreme. \u201cWhen you arrive in the US, they ask you where you\u2019ve been,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cIn New Zealand, they want to see the soles of your boots.\u201d  The more we travel though, the harder it gets to stem the flow. Wherever humans go \u2013 by foot, ship, train, plane, car, bus or bike \u2013 we tote other species along with us. So while there are uninvaded lands left \u2013 and some, like New Zealand, may soon even be reclaimed \u2013 it\u2019s near-impossible to preserve every ecosystem. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can stop the problem or get rid of invasive species entirely,\u201d Genovesi says. \u201cBut we can mitigate their impacts and slow down the pattern of invasions that at the moment is really quite alarming.\u201d  _If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter_.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The last places on Earth with no invasive species", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140909-are-alien-species-everywhere", "countriesMentioned": ["Iceland", "Antarctica", "Cyprus", "Svalbard and Jan Mayen", "French Southern Territories", "United States", "New Zealand", "Puerto Rico", "Argentina", "Ireland", "Australia", "Uruguay"], "author": "Rachel Nuwer"},{"newsText": "![President Trump's first tweet on the @POTUS account showed this image](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/163B/production/_93719650_whatsubject.jpg) Image copyright WHITE HOUSE Image caption President Trump's first tweet on the @POTUS account showed this image  Much is written about the Herculean effort to move one family out of the White House and a new family in within the space of just a few hours.  But in our modern age, the digital moving trucks must also roar into action, as prime presidential online real estate gets a makeover, and eight years of President Obama's social media chat is confined to the national archives.  Let\u2019s start with WhiteHouse.gov, the official website for the President, which as of noon Friday, has a brand new look - and has already provoked mild panic.  Many noted that pages about climate change were swiftly deleted. So too were pages about LGBT rights and various science policies.  But, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Pages about _everything_ were deleted as what was essentially Obama\u2019s homepage was replaced with Trump\u2019s.  That means posts about any former policy positions no longer exist on the White House website if you follow the original links.  So while the web address pointing to the White House\u2019s position on climate change no longer works, the same can be said about Obama\u2019s pages relating to the economy. Unpredictable as he is, no-one is suggesting Donald Trump is about to describe \u201cmoney\u201d as a hoax.  That said, on the new whitehouse.gov, a search for \u201cmilitary\u201d will yield 154 results. \u201cClimate change\u201d? None.  Nervous internet sleuths have found one reference to climate change, a promise to lift the \"harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rules\".  Make of that what you will. People on Twitter certainly are.  Also wiped clean was the White House's petition website. On Friday, by 4pm in DC, only two petitions were posted on the site. The first demanded the release of the President's tax returns. The other demanded he put his businesses in a blind trust. If either petition gets 100,000 signatures, the White House has to provide a response - at least, that was the rule the previous administration set itself.

From today @POTUS \\- President of the United States - has been taken over by the Trump team. All previous tweets from Obama\u2019s team - and Obama himself - have been deleted from that account, but archived under @POTUS44. The 44 relating of course to the fact Obama was the 44th US President.  The tweets were not, as a smattering of people blurted out, \u201cdeleted by Trump\u201d once he had control of the account.  Twitter removed them - and that's because scrubbing the account of Obama\u2019s tweets is a smart move for everyone involved. Had Twitter left the old tweets in place you\u2019ll find yourself seeing people retweeting Obama\u2019s words but with Trump\u2019s identity attached, a recipe for misinformation disaster.  Trump\u2019s first tweet on @POTUS posted a picture and a link to his inaugural address - the full text of which was posted on Facebook. Is Trump having a change of heart over his social network of choice?  Maybe. Facebook certainly offers the chance to speak more clearly at length, and, as the leader of the free world, it would be more useful to post to an audience of almost two billion rather than Twitter\u2019s rather limited 300m.  We won\u2019t know for sure until about 3am, DC time, tomorrow morning.

It currently stands at number 11.  He wants to boost foreign investment as part of his new economic plan.  But some foreign investors are worried about Mr Putin's return as head of state for another term of six years after allegations of vote-rigging and protests both before and following his re-election.  Furthermore, despite Russia's rich resources and its place among the world's fastest-growing economies, there remains a general feeling that the country is underperforming and falling far short of its potential.  According to Angus Roxburgh, former BBC Moscow correspondent and later a public-relations adviser to the Kremlin, there is one overriding reason why Russia is failing to achieve its economic potential and failing to attract outside investors: corruption.  ## Worsening scenario  \"It is something the government acknowledges but seems powerless to combat, despite a regular stream of anti-corruption decrees and initiatives,\" he says.  \"In fact, it gets worse year by year. According to official figures, the average bribe in Russia is more than $10,000,\" he notes.  Transparency International, which ranks countries according to perceived levels of corruption, says Russia has slumped from 46th place in 1996 to 143rd in 2011 .  > Dozens of entrepreneurs are in prison on charges trumped up by officialsAngus Roxburgh, Author  That makes it one of the most corrupt countries on earth.  Bureaucrats in charge of state tenders routinely ask for enormous bribes from companies bidding for the contracts, which adds to the cost of the bills that the state pays.  \"A year or so ago, three seniors officials were convicted - a rare occurrence - for demanding $1m to take the Japanese company Toshiba off a fictitious blacklist, which was preventing the company bidding for a contract,\" Mr Roxburgh recalls.  The case of Sergei Magnitsky, the lawyer employed by a western investment fund, who exposed corruption and then found himself thrown in prison by the very people he had accused, and who then died in prison, has served as a dire warning to all potential investors.  ## Wrong approach  Russian businessmen hate the climate too.  \"Dozens of entrepreneurs are in prison on charges trumped up by officials trying to get their hands on their companies,\" says Mr Roxburgh.  > People in Russia now live in the best way they ever lived in the last 1,000 years in terms of both freedom and in their material wealthSerguei Beloussov, CEO Parallels  The Central Bank reported capital flight from Russia in the first four months of 2012 of $42bn.  The answer seems clear: root out the corrupt officials.  \"But how do you do that if, as most Russians say, the fish rots from the head down.\"  Leaders in the Kremlin are aware of the paradox.  During his four years as President, Dmitry Medvedev made it his priority to modernise the Russian economy by creating the conditions for manufacturing and especially for hi-tech industries to develop.  \"His approach was rather top-down though. He founded an innovation centre in Moscow in a suburb called Skolkovo, which he hoped would become a Russian Silicon Valley,\" Mr Roxburgh points out.  \"He also appointed a former Kremlin chief of staff to establish a global financial centre in Moscow,\" he says, \"But is that how innovations really come about?\"  ## Conquering the difficulties  Some people have managed to prosper despite the real or perceived corrupt climate.  Serguei Beloussov, the founder of Parallels, one of the largest software companies in Russia, says it is always difficult to build a multi-hundred- million-dollar company in any country.  \"The difficulties are just different,\" he explains.  \"For example, in the US there are certain difficulties, such as access to talent, and costs and competition,\" he says.  \"And in Russia, when we were starting our business in 2000, there were other difficulties such as lack of infrastructure, bureaucracy, but it wasn't particularly difficult,\" he maintains.  He acknowledges that political instability can affect his business.  \"I don't think that's a serious concern right now in Russia. Imagine how difficult it would be to do business, for example, in Egypt.\" he says.  \"When I drive from the airport and see how the city looks today, how many large superstores, car dealerships, expensive cars and restaurants you see along the way, and you think how bad the same route was during the Soviet Union, you see how a capitalistic and more democratic system can make a huge return,\" he says.  \"In fact, people in Russia now live in the best way they ever lived in the last 1,000 years in terms of both freedom and in their material wealth.\"", "newsHeadline": "Russia's growth stifled by corruption - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-18622833", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "Egypt", "Russia", "United States"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![Sergei Magnitsky's grave \\(file pic\\)](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/59560000/jpg/_59560419_sergei.jpg) Image caption Sergei Magnitsky had suffered from \"deliberate and inhumane neglect\"  Charges have been dropped against a doctor in the case of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian jail amid claims of torture and neglect.  Larisa Litvinova was one of two doctors facing charges. The case was dropped because the statute of limitations had expired, reports said.  Mr Magnitsky, who worked for a Western investment fund, was detained after accusing officials of tax fraud.  He died after \"deliberate and inhumane neglect\", a report found.  His high-profile death at the age of 37 was taken up by human rights groups as one of the most glaring examples of corruption and prison abuse in modern Russia.  He had suffered from pancreatitis and gallstones and had been found with broken fingers and bruising to his body, the Kremlin's Human Rights Council said in July 2011. There were, it said, grounds to suspect that he had died as a result of a beating.  ## 'Inadvertent act'  Dr Litvinova was the head doctor at Butyrka maximum security prison in Moscow where Mr Magnitsky died in November 2009.

As the first official contact with such a tribe since 1996, the event was out of the ordinary. But the event itself could have been anticipated. For weeks, local villagers in Brazil\u2019s Acre state had reported sightings of the tribesman, who supposedly came to steal crops, axes and machetes, and who \u201cmimicked monkey cries\u201d that frightened women and children.  The Indians\u2019 decision to make contact was not driven by a desire for material goods, however, but by fear. With the help of translators who spoke a closely related indigenous Panoan language, the Acre Indians explained that \u201cviolent attacks\u201d by outsiders had driven them from the forest. Later, details emerged that their elder relatives were massacred, and their houses set on fire. Illegal loggers and cocaine traffickers in Peru, where the Indians are thought to come from, are likely to blame, according to the Brazilian government. Indeed, Funai\u2019s own nearby monitoring post was shut down in 2011 due to increasing escalations with drug traffickers.  _Early contact with the Acre tribe, recorded by Funai_  After they decided the situation called for drastic measures, the Indians did not just stumble upon the Brazilian village by chance \u2013 they probably knew exactly where to go. \u201cThey know far more about the outside world than most people think,\u201d says Fiona Watson, research director for the non-profit organisation Survival International. \u201cThey are experts at living in the forest and are well aware of the presence of outsiders.\u201d  This gets to the heart of a common misconception surrounding isolated tribes such as the one in Acre: that they live in a bubble of wilderness, somehow missing the fact that their small corner of the world is in fact part of a much greater whole \u2013 and one that is dominated by other humans. \u201cAlmost all human communities have been in some contact with one another for as long as we have historical or archaeological records,\u201d says Alex Golub, an anthropologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. \u201cHuman prehistory is not like that game Civilization where you start with a little hut and the whole map is black.\u201d  **Fear factor**  Today\u2019s so-called uncontacted people all have a history of contact, whether from past exploitation or simply seeing a plane flying overhead. The vast majority of an estimated 100 or more isolated tribes live in Brazil, but others can be found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and northern Paraguay. Outside of the Americas, isolated groups live in Papua New Guinea and on North Sentinel Island of India\u2019s Andaman Islands, the latter of which is home to what experts think is the most isolated tribe in the world, the Sentinelese. Nothing is known about their language, and Indian authorities have only rough estimates of how many of them exist today. But even the Sentinelese have had occasional brushes with other societies; members of their tribe have been kidnapped, helicopters sometimes fly over their island and they have killed fishermen who have ventured too close.  It is almost always fear that motivates such hostilities and keeps isolated groups from making contact. In past centuries and even decades, isolated tribes were often murdered and enslaved by outsiders. From the time white Europeans first arrived in the Americas, indigenous peoples learned to fear them, and passed that message down generations through oral histories. \u201cPeople have this romanticised view that isolated tribes have chosen to keep away from the modern, evil world,\u201d says Kim Hill, an anthropologist at Arizona State University. But when Hill and others interview people who recently came out of isolation, the same story emerges time and time again: they were interested in making contact with the outside world, but they were too afraid to do so. As Hill puts it: \u201cThere is no such thing as a group that remains in isolation because they think it\u2019s cool to not have contact with anyone else on the planet.\u201d  Some have personal memories of traumatic encounters with outsiders. In the 1960s and 70s, Brazil largely viewed the Amazon as an empty place in need of development. Indigenous people who stood in the way of that progress were given little or no warning before their homes were bulldozed over \u2013 or they were simply killed. In one case in Brazil\u2019s Rond\u00f4nia state, a single man, often referred to as \u201cthe Last of His Tribe,\u201d remains in a patch of forest surrounded by cattle ranches. His people were likely killed by ranchers years ago. When he was discovered in 1996, he shot arrows at anyone who dared to approach his home. Funai officials sometimes check up on his house and garden, and, as far as anyone knows, he\u2019s still living there today. \u201cIt\u2019s a really sad story of this one little pocket of forest left where this one lone guy lives,\u201d says Robert Walker, an anthropologist at the University of Missouri. \u201cHe\u2019s probably completely terrified of the outside world.\u201d  In some cases in the 70s and 80s, the Brazilian government did try to establish peaceful contact with indigenous people, often with the aim of forced assimilation or relocation. They set up \u201cattraction posts\u201d \u2013 offerings of metal tools and other things indigenous Indians might find to be valuable \u2013 to try and lure them out of hiding. This sometimes led to violent altercations, or, more often than not, disease outbreaks. Isolated people have no immunity to some bugs, which have been known to wipe out up to half of a village\u2019s population in a matter of weeks or months. During those years, missionaries traipsing into the jungle also delivered viruses and bacteria along with Bibles, killing the people they meant to save.  In 1987, Sydney Possuelo \u2013 then head of Funai\u2019s Department of Unknown Tribes \u2013 decided that the current way of doing things was unacceptable. After seeing tribe after tribe demolished by disease, he concluded that isolated people should not be contacted at all. Instead, natural reserves should be placed aside for them to live on, and any contact attempts should be left up to them to initiate. \u201cIsolated people do not manifest among us \u2013 they don\u2019t ask anything of us \u2013 they live and die mostly without our knowledge,\u201d he says. When we do contact them, he says, they too often share a common fate: \u201cdesecration, disease and death.\u201d  **Viral event**  Unfortunately, history seems to be repeating itself. Three weeks after the Indians in Acre made contact, Funai announced that several of them had contracted the flu. All of them subsequently received treatment and vaccinations, but they soon returned to the forest. The fear, now, is that they will carry the foreign virus back with them to their home, spreading it to others who have no natural immunity.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen, other than to make doomsday predictions,\u201d Hill says. \u201cSo far, things are looking just like they looked in the past.\u201d  Possuelo \u2013 who was fired from Funai in 2006 after a disagreement with his boss over some of these concerns \u2013 issues a more direct warning: \u201cWhat they do in Acre is very worrying: they are going to kill the isolated people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe president of Funai and the Head of the Isolated Indians Department should be held accountable for not meeting established standards.\u201d (Funai did not respond to interview requests for this story.)  Surprisingly, no international protocol exists that outlines how to avoid this predicament. \u201cEvery government and group involved in making contact just wings it according to their own resources and experiences,\u201d Hill says.  The common problem is a lack of institutional memory. Even in places like Brazil with decades of experience, Hill says, \u201ceach new government official takes on the task without knowing much about what happened in the past.\u201d Some officials, he adds, have minimal expertise. \u201cQuasi-amateur is what I\u2019d call them: government officials who come in with no medical, anthropological or epidemiological training.\u201d  **Total denial**  The situation in Peru, Watson points out, is even worse. \u201cAt one stage, the Peruvian government denied that uncontacted people even exist,\u201d she says. And now major oil and gas operations are allowed to operate on reserves containing their villages. Added to that is the presence of illegal loggers and drug traffickers \u2013 making for a very crowded forest.  Native people living there seem to be well aware of these encroachments. Google Earth satellite images that Walker recently analysed reveal that one large isolated village in Peru seems to be migrating, year by year, further afield from outside encroachment on their land, including a planned road project. \u201cMost people argue that what\u2019s going on here is that they\u2019re potentially being forced out of Peru,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems like they are running away.\u201d  When accidental harm from the outside world seems inevitable, Hill argues it would be better if we initiated contact. Slowly building up a long-distance friendship, he explains, and then carrying out a controlled contact meeting with medical personnel on site would be preferable. After that initial contact is made, anthropologists should be prepared to go back into the forest with the group and stay on site to monitor the situation for several months, as well as build up trust and communication. That way, if an epidemic should break out, help can be called for. \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell them after 15 minutes, \u2018Oh, by the way, if your whole village gets sick, send everyone out to this spot to get medical treatment,\u2019\u201d Hill says. \u201cThey won\u2019t comply with that.\u201d  It\u2019s unclear whether or not such a plan is being carried out in Acre, however. \u201cFunai is not the most transparent organisation, and they have complete monopoly on what happens to remote people in Brazil,\u201d Hill says. \u201cUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t work in the best interest of native peoples.\u201d  To ensure isolated groups have a future, both Brazil and Peru might need to become more transparent as well as more proactive about protecting them. No matter how remote the Amazon might seem, unlike the Sentinelese, South America\u2019s isolated groups do not live on an island cut off from the forces of mainstream society. \u201cEverywhere you look, there are these pressures from mining, logging, narcotrafficking and other external threats,\u201d Walker says. \u201cMy worry is that if we have this \u2018leave-them-alone\u2019 strategy, at the end of the day the external threats will win. People will just go extinct.\u201d  _Thanks to __Jo\u00e3o Victor Geronasso for translation help for this story.   _   _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Anthropology: The sad truth about uncontacted tribes", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140804-sad-truth-of-uncontacted-tribes", "countriesMentioned": ["Peru", "Brazil", "United Kingdom", "China", "Colombia", "Ecuador", "United States", "Israel", "Panama", "Canada"], "author": "Rachel Nuwer"},{"newsText": "![World-changing ideas summit](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p049vjvx.png)  Upcoming event  World-Changing Ideas Summit  This story is part of a series inspired by the subjects and speakers appearing at BBC Future\u2019s World-Changing Ideas Summit in Sydney on 15 November.

What if we could change TV channels just by thinking about our favourite programme? Or drive a car with the power of our minds, leaving our arms and legs resting?  In theory, there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t have mind-operated bionic suits, like the one Robert Downey Jnr wore in the movie Iron Man, or turn our brains into universal remote controls that could operate every device in the house. But even with the best emerging technology, there are risks to connecting our minds with machines.  The development of new mind-machine interfaces is one of the topics that will be discussed at BBC Future\u2019s World-Changing Ideas Summit in Sydney on 15 November.  **CAN\u2019T I ALREADY BUY MACHINES CONTROLLED BY THOUGHT POWER?**  There are several consumer toys that promise to work by harnessing the power of thought, however, none of them are likely to give you the dexterity and power of controlling an Ironman suit just yet. A range of gadgets are available, from wired skull caps that let you command a video game, to a fan that blows a ball through a hoop by employing your brainwaves. The drawback of these consumer products is they read your brain\u2019s electric activity through the not-inconsiderable signal dampener of your skull.  **WHAT ABOUT BRAIN IMPLANTS?**  Medical science is creating more advanced options for people who are paralysed or who have lost limbs. Last year, a paralysed woman had a small sensor implanted on the left side of her brain, allowing her to control the equivalent of a Bluetooth mouse to \u2018tap\u2019 a touchscreen on a tablet. Other surgeons at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine fitted a young man with 128 electrode sensors on the part of his motor cortex controlling hand and arm movements, enabling him to wiggle the individual fingers of a bionic arm.  At the World-Changing Ideas Summit, the neurosurgeon Jeffrey Rosenfeld of Monash University will talk about direct-to-brain \u201cbionic eyes\u201d that he and his colleagues are developing to assist the blind. The idea is that signals from a pair of glasses would feed directly into an implant in the brain\u2019s visual cortex \u2013 a development that the team claim could help up to 85% of the clinically blind. Because the information is going direct to the brain, the technology promises to help those who could not benefit from retinal implants, another form of bionic eye. Human trials are planned for 2017.  Interfaces linking people\u2019s brains to prosthetics are getting better, but they also have a drawback. To achieve a clear reading of the brain\u2019s electric signals, surgeons must open or penetrate the skull to implant electrodes directly onto the brain\u2019s surface. This kind of surgery has obvious risks, and after a while scar tissue can build around the electrodes, muffling the signal.  **_Watch: The code that may treat blindness_**  **IS THERE A GENTLER WAY TO GET CLEAR SIGNALS, WITHOUT CUTTING INTO THE SKULL?**  There is a less dramatic option, although so far it has only been tested on sheep.\u00a0Nicholas Opie and colleagues at the University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital and the\u00a0Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health are developing a device called a stentrode, which is so tiny it can sit within a human blood vessel. Surgeons insert a slim, flexible stent into a blood vessel in the groin, then guide the device up through the body and into the motor cortex, the brain\u2019s movement command centre. There, the stentrode sits in a blood vessel, collecting signals 24/7.  Ultimately, the researchers want the stentrode to \u2018speak to\u2019 an exoskeleton, returning mobility to people who have lost the use of their limbs. Paraplegic or quadriplegic patients \u2014 probably young people who have been relatively recently injured \u2014 might be asked to test the device in Melbourne as soon as late 2017.  It might also one day be possible for the stentrode to deliver feedback the other way, to the brain\u2019s sensory cortex. Allowing people using bionic limbs to \u2018feel\u2019 what they are touching would open many more treatment possibilities. \u201cIf you want to pick up an egg, you don\u2019t want to squeeze too hard, so getting some feedback about how much pressure you\u2019re applying with your robot hand is going to matter a lot,\u201d says David Grayden, an electrical engineer on the project.  **SO WILL WE ALL SOON GET MIND-CONTROLLED DEVICES?\u00a0**  If the human trial succeeds, the stentrode could be commercially available in about six years. But while a stent is less invasive than skull surgery, it still requires inserting a device into your brain. The safety trade-off may well be worthwhile for people who stand to regain bodily movement, says Grayden, but it\u2019s hard for him to foresee a day when people will implant electrodes solely for convenience.  \u201cJust that process of putting it in is a dangerous thing to do. You are still invading the body and you\u2019d be wanting to make sure that the benefit outweighs the risk,\u201d he says. The quest for more accurate, less invasive alternatives will no doubt continue. But it might be a while before we\u2019re sprinting to work in a mind-controlled exoskeleton.  _Join 700,000+ Future fans by liking us on_\u00a0_**Facebook**__, or follow us on_ _**Twitter**__,_\u00a0_**Google+**__,_\u00a0_**LinkedIn**_\u00a0_and_\u00a0_**Instagram**_  _If you liked this story, __sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter__, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Cats on the internet are over. Done. \"Cheezburgers\" are off the menu. Play yourself out, Keyboard Cat.  While in years past we\u2019ve perhaps welcomed the charming cynicism of the likes of Grumpy Cat, it seems people of the internet are now, in stranger times, longing instead for the unconditional and unwavering love of dogs - and I have the highly subjective data to prove it.  **Trending**  Let\u2019s start with Reddit. The top three posts of all time on its r/aww subreddit, the section for all things cuddly, are all about dogs.  \"But wait!\" you might say. \"The fourth one is a cat!\". Ah, but is it? It begins with a cat, but watch closely as it climbs out of its cage and into the one next to it. What does the cat find? A dog! That should be all the proof you need.  If it isn\u2019t, here\u2019s something a bit more concrete.  Image caption This is Gavin, a very good dog  Socialbakers is a company that monitors social media for trends and stats relating to things that are most popular. I got in touch with them about this, and within hours they came back to me with the goods.  For starters, the runaway champion of most popular animal on Facebook is a dog named Boo. He\u2019s got more than 17.5m likes, more than double that of his closest competitor, Grumpy Cat.  In third place, Nyan Cat - who isn\u2019t even a real cat, for crying out loud.  On Instagram, fine, I\u2019ll admit, the top celebrity is a cat. But 2nd, 3rd and 4th place? All dogs. All _good_ dogs.  When it comes to searches on Google, dogs .  But more significant was the historic moment on 3 January 2016, when, for the first time, the term \"cute dogs\" overtook \"funny cats\" in global searches.  I think I\u2019ve proved my point.  **Puppers**  Like any viral phenomena, there\u2019s a new vocabulary to get your head around if you are to be a part of this new term of internet governance.  Dogs aren\u2019t just dogs. They\u2019re doggos. Puppies are puppers. And while not all puppers can be considered doggos, all doggos are most certainly puppers. Or woofers. Woofers that bork. If you want, you can boop a doggo\u2019s snoot. That is - to lightly bop on one\u2019s nose.  Image copyright Andy Collett Image caption This is Loki, a very good dog  When in mild distress, or sometimes just for emphasis, their chosen curse word is the ferociously aggressive \"heckin\".  Oh, and if a dog sticks his or her tongue out a little bit? That's a blep.  Like any new language, the best way to learn is to engross yourself in the culture - and one fine place that speaks fluent doggo is the happiest corner of the internet, Facebook\u2019s Cool Dog Group (CDG).  Here you\u2019ll find the likes of Igor, who, let me tell you folks, is a born superstar, believe me.  Igor\u2019s just one of hundreds of puppers posted every week, a most welcome addition to news feeds that would otherwise be clogged up with baby pictures and wedding photos. You\u2019re welcome.  **\u2018They\u2019re good dogs, Brent.\u2019**  It\u2019s the grassroots of doggo appreciation that has the movement set to make huge strides in 2017.  Image copyright WeRateDogs Image caption Brant gets his comeuppance  It\u2019s being spearheaded by Matt Nelson, a 20-year-old who studies golf course management in North Carolina, and a man described by serious newspaper Washington Post as \"the internet\u2019s most famous dog rater\".  Nelson runs the WeRateDogs account on Twitter. People submit dogs to be rated, and Nelson will consider the merits of said dog and provide a score out of 10.  Recent scores: 12/10 for Hercules, 13/10 for Duchess and 14/10 for Sundance who, in a short clip, plays the drums.  Late last year this generous but fair system was brought into disrepute by the user Brant, who questioned why all the dogs got such unfathomably high ratings.  \"They\u2019re good dogs, Brent,\" replied Nelson - an era-defining retort which you can now buy on a hoodie. Or a mug.  Since then, popularity has exploded. He now has over a million followers.  \"We started up an e-commerce store,\" Matt tells me. \"We have a book deal. So many things I thought you could never do with just a Twitter account.\"  **Therapy dogs**  You could say there\u2019s plenty of data out there to suggest that I\u2019m wrong, and that cats are still very much in control. And you\u2019d be right - I found plenty evidence which completely disproves the theory I\u2019ve outlined here, but I\u2019ve left it out as I don\u2019t care.  There was one piece from Gizmodo in 2015 that suggested there were scientific reasons to why cat memes were more popular online - but to that I say WRONG. Fake meows.  Because the web is just _different_ now. Looking at cat pictures was a way to waste time by mucking about on the internet.  Image copyright Instagram: @zuluthestaffy Image caption This is Zulu, a very good dog  Now, like the therapy dogs of the real world, internet doggos are supplying a much needed diversion from the humourless drudgery that makes up much of the modern social web.  \"Dogs are just a pure innocent thing,\" Matt Nelson says. \"They are the embodiment of unconditional love, and that\u2019s what people want now.  \"I see my account as this refuge of something bright on the internet.\"  And so that\u2019s it.

Say the phrase \"the party of crooks and thieves\", and almost everyone knows who you are talking about - the ruling party, Vladimir Putin's United Russia.  Although United Russia looks likely to win again in parliamentary elections on Sunday, there is growing dissatisfaction in the country.  Over the past few years, people have seen bureaucrats and politicians buying mansions and luxury cars, way beyond anything their official salaries could pay for.  The word \"korruptsiya\" (corruption) is on the lips of businessmen and pensioners - and even Kremlin spin-doctors.  ## Contrasting cases  The most infamous recent case of alleged corruption centres on the death of Sergei Magnitsky.  He was a young corporate lawyer working on behalf of Hermitage Capital, a British investment fund specialising in Russia.  Sergei Magnitsky discovered what he thought was a massive tax fraud. He believed that officials had wrongly awarded a $230m (\u00a3145m) tax refund, which had ended up in criminal hands.  But the bureaucrats and policemen he accused turned the tables on him. He was arrested, and a year later he died in prison after a severe beating and months of medical neglect.  His fate contrasts with that of Olga Stepanova, the woman who authorised the tax refund. She is one of a group of officials who suddenly became very rich.  Her mother-in-law is now the registered owner of an ultra-modern country house outside Moscow worth an estimated $20m, and her husband owns luxury villas in Montenegro and Dubai.  Image caption Sergei Magnitsky, a young corporate lawyer who discovered a huge apparent tax fraud, is now dead  She says the money came from her husband's business, but their annual joint tax returns show an income of around $38,000.  ## 'No conscience'  It is two years since Sergei Magnitsky died, but none of those he accused of the tax fraud has been brought to justice.  \"It's terrible. I don't know how these people live with themselves,\" his mother Natalya Magnitskaya said. \"They have no conscience. And I find it very difficult to come to terms with that.\"  For many observers the case of Sergei Magnitsky has come to symbolise much of what is wrong with modern Russia.  It exemplifies a system which seems to allow some officials to become very rich without any comeback. The era of the oligarchs was the 1990s; this is the age of the millionaire Russian bureaucrat.  Drive along Rublyovo-Uspyenskoye Shosse into the countryside to the west of Moscow, and the scale of the enrichment of officials becomes clear.  > It's very dangerous when people start to hate those who must serve themGennady Gudkov, Opposition politician  It looks like the sort of place where only millionaires would live, but here Russia's new rich reside - the ministers and officials.  Some of the money comes from legitimate businesses. But much comes from bribes, from government contracts given to friends and relatives, and from seats on boards with a clear conflict of interest.  Giorgy Dzagurov is the owner of Penny Lane Realty, one of Moscow's biggest real estate agents.  \"I would say that 40% to 60% of buyers of top-end housing in Russia are Russian governmental employees,\" he said. \"That does not necessarily mean it comes from corruption, but some properties are directly purchased from bribes.\"  The mansions on the Nikolino Elite Settlement are worth $20m or more, but among the residents is Boris Gromov, the governor of the Moscow Region.  He owns no businesses, and the only jobs he has ever done are soldier and politician. His official salary is around $125,000.  ## Car audit  Then there are the luxury cars.  Gennady Gudkov, who is a member of opposition party Just Russia in parliament, carried out an investigation into expensive cars being bought with state funds.  > We have not achieved the proper balance between the executive, legislative power and also our court system. We are in the process of the construction of this balanceVladimir Pligin, Member of ruling United Russia party  He found that even small departments and universities were buying top-of-the- range Audis, BMWs and Mercedes Benzes.  \"Our bureaucrats did not save any money. They spent a lot just for their luxury. Just for their pleasure. Taking no attention to the needs of the people, of common people,\" he complained.  \"They do what they want, paying no attention to the needs of common people. That's the result of a lack of control and impunity.  \"It's very dangerous when people start to hate those who must serve them. They see them using these luxury cars when salaries go down, and all other benefits go down.\"  In most democracies it is the parliament that gives the population an official voice, providing a check on the executive.  But Russia's parliament, the Duma, has had its wings badly clipped during the Putin years.  ## Charade  At a recent debate on corruption none of the deputies appeared to be listening to the speeches.  The voting was a bizarre charade in which deputies ran around pressing the voting buttons on behalf of absent colleagues - even the parliamentary procedures were a fraud.  Vladimir Pligin is one of the better-respected members of the ruling United Russia party. He says he knows the problems but asks people to be patient  \"We have not achieved the proper balance between the executive, legislative power and also our court system. We are in the process of the construction of this balance,\" he explained.  He said that the process had been going on for \"only 20 years - not a big period of time from the historical point of view\".  The problem is that the system of corruption is becoming entrenched.  By the time democratic reform comes along, the patience of the people of Russia may have run out.", "newsHeadline": "Russians tire of corruption spectacle - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15972326", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "United Arab Emirates", "Russia", "United States", "Brazil"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionScience correspondent Rebecca Morelle: \"Scientists here are saying this is the tip of the iceberg\"  The American space agency's New Horizons probe has returned further images of Pluto that include a view of the dwarf planet's strange icy plains.  A region, which has been named after the Soviet Sputnik satellite, displays a flat terrain broken up into polygons.  At the edges of these 20-30km-wide features are troughs filled with dark material and even small mounds.  Scientists say it could be evidence of the surface bulging due to gentle heating coming from below.  But it could just as easily be the result of some contraction process as materials vaporise into the atmosphere - not unlike how mud cracks form on Earth.  Science team members say they are trying not to jump to early conclusions in their interpretations - certainly not until they get more data down from the spacecraft.  \"When I first saw the image of Sputnik plain I decided I was going to call it 'not easy to explain terrain',\" said Jeff Moore, who leads the geology, geophysics and imaging team on New Horizons.  At a media briefing at Nasa HQ in Washington DC, the mission team also showed a first picture of Nix, one of Pluto's smaller moons.  It is not particularly well resolved, being only about 15 pixels in the longest dimension. Nonetheless, researchers can now get a good sense of its shape and size (roughly 40km across).  \"Let's set out expectations properly,\" said lead scientist Alan Stern. \"As little as three months ago, we didn't have pictures of Pluto this good!\"  Image copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption Nix: It looks roundish in this view, but it is actually quite elongated  Other measurements by the probe concern its observations of Pluto's nitrogen- rich atmosphere, which models suggest it is probably losing at a rate of about 500 tonnes per hour. It is being stripped away by the stream of energetic, charged particles coming off the Sun.  Pluto's diminutive size (2,370km diameter) means it does not have the gravity to hang on to the atmosphere - in the same way that a bigger world like Earth or even Mars can - and it flows into space, forming a long ionised tail going in the same direction as all those solar wind particles. New Horizons has sent back some early data on this process.  By way of comparison, Mars loses only about one tonne of atmosphere per hour, explained Fran Bagenal, a co-investigator at the University of Colorado.  \"What is the consequence of [Pluto's loss]?\" she pondered. \"If you add that loss up over the age of the Solar System, this is going to be equivalent to something on the order of 1,000-9,000ft - so that's a substantial mountain - of nitrogen ice that's been removed.\"  This is not enough to take away all of Pluto's atmosphere, but it is very likely to have effects at the surface where ices continue to vaporise.  Other fascinating observations include a concentration of carbon monoxide ice in the western sector of the light-coloured region on Pluto that looks like a heart; and also some surface streaks that appear similar to the kind of erosion or deposition marks you get behind an obstacle when it sits in the path of a persistent wind.  At the media conference, there was speculation that these streaks could also be plume deposits. However, the team stressed no active emissions from the surface, such as geysers, had yet been detected.  Image copyright kk Image caption The mission team has so far released three close-up views, tied together in this mosaic for context by Ken Kremer and Marco Di Lorenzo  Image copyright NASA/jhu-apl/swri Image caption New Horizons detects a strong carbon monoxide signal in Pluto's \"heart\" region  After its historic flyby on Tuesday, New Horizons continues to monitor the dwarf planet and its five satellites - Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.  Even though it has gone more than three million km beyond the Pluto system, there is still much to learn by looking in \"the rear-view mirror\".  As it recedes ever further into the distance, New Horizons will be staring intently at the crescent edge of Pluto, to see if there are hazes and even clouds in its tenuous atmosphere.  It is also hunting for rings. It is possible that concentric circles of dusty, icy particles surround the dwarf.  Such rings would scatter sunlight in a way that might be easier to detect when looking from the \"night side\".  Image copyright NASA/jhu-apl/swri Image caption Composite image of Pluto and Charon. They were pictured separately on approach, but their relative size is broadly correct  The probe has so far sent back only a tiny amount of its stored flyby data - perhaps 2%.  The vast distance to Pluto (4.7 billion km) and the modest transmitter/antenna system (12 watts) onboard makes for very low bit rates - an average of one kilobit per second.  This could be boosted by diverting power away from the inertial measurement unit that helps maintain New Horizons' stability.  And the team does plan to do this, spinning up the spacecraft to achieve a steady orientation instead.  However, the probe cannot spin and take images at the same time; and scientists are keen to observe Pluto for at least another two full rotations before making the change.  The final long-range picture is scheduled to be taken on 30 July, with the spin-up taking place a day later.  New Horizons will then send back all of its data - about 50 gigabits - in compressed form, starting in September, before repeating the downlink in an uncompressed form.  \"To do everything in every form for all six objects in the system will take 16 months,\" said Prof Stern.  The BBC will be screening a special Sky At Night programme called Pluto Revealed on Monday 20 July, which will recap all the big moments from the New Horizons flyby.

I\u2019ve written at length about President Trump\u2019s relationship with the technology heartland.  On the one side, you have the likes of Paypal founder and major investor Peter Thiel, who is now very much part of Trump\u2019s inner circle.  On the other, you have tech bigwigs like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Alphabet\u2019s Larry Page, who were cooperative but mostly quiet when honouring the then President- Elect\u2019s invite to meet him at Trump Tower last year.  Little has been said about that meeting since. The silence from most of Silicon Valley has been deafening - to the frustration of many here - but you get the sense that could all change if the companies are called upon to implement any policy decisions they consider unethical.  For instance, there\u2019s a growing list of employees at tech firms who have noted they will refuse to work on a \u201cdatabase\u201d of minorities, if asked. All hypothetical, of course.  Until such a thing happens it seems much of the tech elite are just keeping their heads down.  ## \u2018Move the needle'  But not Mr Musk.  In a series of tweets posted over the course of this week he has praised Trump\u2019s Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson.  \"This may sound surprising coming from me,\u201d he wrote in a tweet. \u201cBut I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.\u201d  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tesla is creating jobs in US manufacturing - though robots do plenty of the work too  His reasoning appeared to stem from remarks Mr Tillerson made in the past about supporting a carbon tax - something Mr Musk said was the only way to \u201cmove the needle\u201d when it came to combating climate change. Unlike the President, who tweeted that he thought climate change was a hoax, Mr Tillerson has acknowledged the reality.  Before the election, Mr Musk described Mr Trump as \u201cprobably not the right guy\u201d for the job of running the US. But since then he has accepted an invitation, along with Uber\u2019s Travis Kalanick and 14 others, to join an advisory panel for the President.  That panel will \"meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda\u201d.  This backfired on Uber a little - protestors have gathered outside its San Francisco HQ over the past week - but as ever it\u2019s hard to assess what tangible effect this has on the company (surge pricing was off the charts after the march on Saturday, for instance).  ## Feather in Trump\u2019s cap  Short term PR hit aside, more important to Mr Musk\u2019s bottom line would surely be what happens to the tax breaks his company, and its customers, currently enjoy.  The price of buying a Tesla car is lowered considerably thanks to measures put in by the Obama administration. And in Nevada, where Mr Musk is building his enormous Gigafactory, there are reports the company is enjoying more than a billion dollars worth of tax incentives.  Here\u2019s where Mr Musk and Mr Trump will surely see eye-to-eye. Tesla is a company investing big in US manufacturing. The Gigafactory will eventually employ more than 6,000 people, Tesla has said. And that\u2019s just the battery factory. The cars are being made in Fremont, California, where another 6,000 or so could soon work.  Mr Musk also presents President Trump with an irresistible feather in his Make America Great Again cap - the chance to re-ignite the space race.  SpaceX, Mr Musk\u2019s space exploration company, has already taken up some contracts from Nasa, but there are presumably more tasks Mr Musk would like to get involved with. You get the feeling space travel might just appeal to Mr Trump\u2019s sense of grandeur.  ## Tunnel vision  Gizmodo has more on this. In an \u201cinterview\u201d published today, conducted via direct messages on Twitter, Mr Musk urged his tweets to be taken \u201cas they are written\u201d.  Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Musk (L) met President Trump again earlier this week  \u201cThe more voices of reason that the President hears, the better,\u201d he is quoted as saying.  \"Simply attacking him will achieve nothing. Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks?  \"Better that there are open channels of communication.\u201d  On the new Secretary of State, he said: \"Tillerson obviously did a competent job running Exxon, one of the largest companies in the world. In that role, he was obligated to advance the cause of Exxon and did.  \"In the Sec of State role, he is obligated to advance the cause of the US and I suspect he probably will.\u201d  Ever the multi-tasker, Mr Musk went on to tweet on Wednesday about his plans to dig a tunnel to avoid traffic in Los Angeles.  Where will this tunnel begin? \u201cAcross from my desk,\u201d Mr Musk said.

The appointment has raised concerns among internet rights activists that laws ensuring net neutrality are now under threat.  Net neutrality is the term given to the view that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally - rather than, for instance, internet service providers being allowed to charge more for a \u201cfast lane\u201d for people wanting to use data-heavy services such as Netflix.  Supporters of net neutrality - which includes Google and Facebook - believe it is vital to ensure competition among online companies.  If a fledgling video service could not afford to be in the so-called fast lane it would struggle to compete with the likes of YouTube or Vimeo, they argue.  Typically, Republican members of the FCC have voted unsuccessfully against net neutrality - under President Trump the commission will have a Republican majority.  **\u2018Fire up the weed whacker'**  Under President Obama, the laws over net neutrality were regularly debated, often provoking a strong public response.  In 2015 landmark laws were passed to protect net neutrality, a move seen as a major victory for advocates who had worried the corporate tide was pushing heavily against them.  However, Mr Pai, speaking after President Trump\u2019s election win, said: \"During the Trump administration, we will shift from playing defence at the FCC to going on [the] offence.  \"We need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation, and job creation.\u201d  Mr Pai was already an FCC commissioner and so therefore can move directly into the role without a Senate confirmation hearing.  In the past he voted against strengthening net neutrality laws.  Craig Aaron, president of communications advocacy group Free Press, said: \u201cAjit Pai has been on the wrong side of just about every major issue that has come before the FCC during his tenure. He\u2019s never met a mega-merger he didn\u2019t like or a public safeguard he didn\u2019t try to undermine.\u201d  **Contradicting Trump**  But the appointment was welcomed on Monday by telecoms giant Verizon, Mr Pai\u2019s former employer, as well as other internet service providers such as Comcast and AT&amp;T.  For AT&amp;T in particular, the move could spell extremely good news.  Mr Pai is said to be supportive of the mega-merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner announced last year.  This contradicts President Trump\u2019s assurance the merger was \"a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few\u201d.  Time Warner is also the parent company of CNN, the network that has come in for the most criticism from President Trump.  In a statement, AT&amp;T said: \"Chairman Pai will work with his fellow commissioners to quickly and decisively put back in place the commonsense regulatory framework necessary to support the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d  **_Follow Dave Lee _**on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC**_ and _**on Facebook", "newsHeadline": "Neutrality fear over Trump appointee - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38727781", "countriesMentioned": ["Bahamas", "Japan"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "It\u2019s the ultimate experience \u2013 an event that will change your life. And whether you\u2019re a billionaire, millionaire or just incredibly wealthy, the space tourism industry has something to offer. So far, only seven space tourists have flown in space but, all being well, over the next couple of years that\u2019s going to change. Big time. And, if you\u2019ve got the money, you could be part of it.  I\u2019m not going to pretend the experience will be cheap but whether you want a quick sub-orbital thrill, a week staring out of the window of the International Space Station (ISS) or a daring mission to the far side of the Moon, it\u2019s going to be considerably cheaper than it was for Nasa.  Neither is it without its risks. Even today, there is nothing routine about spaceflight. Some of these companies are relying on tried and tested Russian spacecraft but the others are stretching new technology to its limits. Just hope you\u2019re not on board when those limits are discovered.  But, if you\u2019ve saved your money and signed the waiver form, here\u2019s what you can expect from a selection of the major players in this fledgling market.  **VIRGIN GALACTIC   **  **Mission:** Space is Virgin Territory  **The experience:** After a few days of training alongside your five fellow crewmembers, you don your spacesuit and take your seat in the VSS Enterprise rocket plane. \u00a0Slung beneath the wings of the WhiteKnight Two twin-hulled aircraft, your rocket is carried 50,000 ft (15,000m) into the clear skies over the Mojave Desert. With everything checked out, WhiteKnight releases Enterprise, the pilot hits the start button and you\u2019re thrust back into your seat as the rocket powers into space.  After the engines have cut off, it\u2019ll be completely silent (apart from the exclamations from your fellow passengers) and you\u2019ll have around five to six minutes of weightlessness when you\u2019re free to float around the cabin and peer out of the large windows to the Earth below. Then it\u2019s back to your seat, as gravity takes over and the spacecraft descends\u2013 at some speed \u2013 to land back on the runway.  **What they say:** \u201cIt has been specifically designed to give as many people as possible, an affordable, fantastic experience,\u201d Virgin Galactic commercial director, Stephen Attenborough, tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s the astronaut experience, so it\u2019s the rocket ride to space, it\u2019s having a big cabin that you can float around in zero gravity, it\u2019s got big windows, so you\u2019ve got fantastic views of Earth, it\u2019s all run by Virgin so you\u2019ll have a fantastic experience and you\u2019ll come back an astronaut!\u201d  **Cost:** $200,000  **Wow factor:** 8/10  **Warped factor:** 6/10  **Verdict:** It\u2019s likely to happen in the near future and is certainly going to be a thrill-ride. But it might leave would-be astronauts wanting more.  **SPACE EXPEDITION CORPORATION (SXC)**  **Mission:** A life changing experience  **The experience:** SXC are working with XCOR Aerospace, the developers of the Lynx suborbital space plane. Equipped with four rocket engines, the plane is designed to take off and land on a runway. What\u2019s neat about these engines is that they can be ignited and shut down at any time during flight. However, the Lynx has yet to fly.  As a passenger on board, you will be strapped into the cockpit at the front alongside the pilot. After take off, the plane will climb rapidly at three times the speed of sound to 58km (36 miles) above the Earth. At that point, the pilot will shut off the engines and let the plane coast upwards for another 40km (25 miles) as you start to descend in an arc back towards the Earth. You\u2019ll experience around 4Gs of force as the plane re-enters the atmosphere, before it glides back for a horizontal landing.  **What they say:** \u201cI\u2019d offer you a pinnacle life event,\u201d says XCOR chief operating officer, Andrew Nelson when I ask him what they\u2019re selling. \u201cI\u2019d offer you excitement, I\u2019d offer you adventure, I\u2019d offer you some wonderful experiences\u2026but really at the heart and soul of it we\u2019d offer you the opportunity to explore who you are and what you\u2019re made of.\u201d And, he adds, in a gentle dig at his competitors: \u201cyou\u2019re not at the back of the bus with windows, you\u2019re right up front\u2026if you get on an airplane and you\u2019d rather turn to the left than the right, then you\u2019re probably a good customer for us.\u201d  **Cost:** $95,000  **Wow factor:** 7/10  **Warped factor:** 8/10  **Verdict:** Virgin on steroids but you don\u2019t get to float around the cabin. The plane hasn\u2019t flown yet.  **SPACE ADVENTURES   **  **Mission:** Delivering spaceflight experiences.  **The experience:** Space Adventures is the only company with a track record in space tourism. So far they\u2019ve flown eight missions and seven astronauts (one person flew twice) to the ISS. Clients fly as passengers in Soyuz spacecraft alongside fully trained cosmonauts. Soyuz is the world\u2019s most reliable \u2013 and now only \u2013manned spacecraft.  Before being allowed to fly, you\u2019ll have to pass tough medical exams and undergo months of training for Soyuz and the ISS. You may also have to learn Russian. Assuming you pass the tests, you\u2019ll blast off \u2013 alongside two professional cosmonauts \u2013 from the historic Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.  After a couple of days in orbit, your capsule will dock with the ISS and you\u2019ll get to spend more than a week on board. Participants have used this opportunity to try experiments or work on education projects. Every astronaut who\u2019s flown on the ISS has recommended spending as much time as possible looking out of the window at the Earth. Although you\u2019ll be treated well by the professional astronauts and cosmonauts, Nasa has been quite disapproving of these flights in the past and this may cause you problems. When your time in orbit is at an end, you\u2019ll return in the Soyuz capsule for a bumpy landing somewhere in Kazakhstan.  Space Adventures also offers parabolic \u201cweightless\u201d experiences in specially converted aircraft and is planning suborbital flights, as well as an ambitious mission beyond Earth orbit to circle around the Moon.  **What they say****:** \u201cYou\u2019re 250 miles above the Earth, going around the Earth every 90 minutes, an absolutely spectacular experience,\u201d and with that, Tom Shelly, president of Space Adventures, really doesn\u2019t have to add anything. \u00a0  **Cost:** $50 million  **Wow factor:** 9/10  **Warped factor:** 7/10  **Verdict:** How much?!? You\u2019ll have to commit to months of training. The only company that\u2019s actually done it.  **EXCALIBUR ALMAZ**  **Mission:** Engage, Explore, Inspire  **The experience:** extraordinary name, extraordinary plans. Excalibur Almaz Limited is a private company based on the Isle of Man \u2013 a small island off the west coast of Britain. Here, it has some serious ex-Russian space hardware including two space stations (similar to the Russian modules of the ISS) and four ex-Soviet military reusable space capsules.  This is no ordinary space tourism company, Excalibur Almaz plans to launch the first private space station and, by fitting its habitation modules with engines, to support expeditions around the Moon and even beyond. Each module is six times the size of Nasa\u2019s Orion capsule, which will make them the biggest manned spacecraft ever launched.  **What they say****:** \u201cWe\u2019re in the business of private expeditions into outer space,\u201d explains company chairman, Art Duler, who says he wants to make Britain a \u201cspacefaring society\u201d.  \u201cThe great discoveries of the 21st Century haven\u2019t been made yet, they will be made in space \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d  The ultimate mission is to travel beyond Earth\u2019s orbit to a Lagrange point \u2013 the positions in space where gravitational forces balance out \u2013 and then loop back around the Moon. \u201cIt\u2019ll take about six to eight months, it\u2019s a real exploration of discovery to specific places that have great scientific interest. This is a bespoke charter mission to beyond the Moon\u2026one for the history books I think.\u201d  Funded by the astronauts who take part, or anyone who wants to sponsor them, this isn\u2019t going to be cheap.  **Cost:** $100 million a seat (three available)  **Wow factor:** 10/10  **Warped factor:** 10/10  **Verdict:** This is hugely ambitious but, if it happens, it\u2019ll put the world\u2019s space agencies to shame.  _Which one would you take?_ _Let us know over at our Facebook page or message us on Twitter._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Space: A travel guide", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120622-space-a-travel-guide", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "Kazakhstan", "Virgin Islands, U.S.", "United States", "Canada", "France"], "author": "Richard Hollingham"},{"newsText": "Two short blocks from the London headquarters of Britain\u2019s security service, MI6, a group of 30 men and women is plotting to overthrow the government.  Not \u2013 and I should make this abundantly clear for any spooks reading this \u2013 the British government, nor any government on Earth, but a tyrannical administration on an alien world in the future.  This is not a game. The scientists, engineers, social scientists, philosophers and writers gathered at the British Interplanetary Society in London are taking their task seriously \u2013 studying, with academic rigour, the problem of toppling despotic extraterrestrial regimes.  > We\u2019ve got a chance to think about what the problems might be in outer space before we go there - Charles Cockell  This is the third annual conference on extraterrestrial liberty. Last year the event tackled the challenge of writing a constitution for an alien settlement, concluding that successful space colonies should base laws and liberties on the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.  \u201cThis year we\u2019re discussing what happens if you don\u2019t like the government you\u2019ve created and want to overthrow it,\u201d says conference organiser Charles Cockell, a professor of astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh.  Conclusions from these meetings will be published as essays, designed to serve as manuals for future spacefarers.  \u201cWe hope the discussions we have will constitute the first ideas on extraterrestrial liberty,\u201d Cockell says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a chance to think about what the problems might be in outer space before we go there.\u201d  The scenarios the group is contemplating are easiest to imagine if you think about what a space colony might be like. Perhaps a domed settlement with a few hundred residents, beneath a thin dusty Martian sky. A fragile and isolated outpost of humanity 225 million kilometres from the home world. With a brutal dictator and his cronies in charge of the oxygen generators, for instance.  **Non-violent opposition   **  \u201cSay, for example, you don\u2019t like your government and you resort to revolution,\u201d says Cockell. \u201cSomeone goes and smashes up the habitat, destroys the windows and instantly the place is depressurised, the oxygen is lost and everyone dies.  \u201cThe consequences of violence in space could be much more catastrophic than on Earth,\u201d he warns, \u201cSo how do you dissent in an environment in which violent disobedience might kill everyone?\u201d  The answer lies, Cockell believes, in preventing dictatorships emerging in the first place. This would be achieved by building non-violent means of opposition to government into the rulebook, perhaps through organised labour systems \u2013 similar to unions on Earth \u2013 or by holding the leadership to account through journalism and media.  > In space, private corporations could be just as ruthless and despotic as the worst governments  \u201cOnce you stop a free press in an extraterrestrial environment, you\u2019re actually in deep trouble,\u201d he says.  The physical structure of the settlements could also be designed to minimise the effects of conflict, with air, water and power systems in multiple locations. Not only would this reduce vulnerabilities to a break down or failure but it would avoid the dangers of a central point of control.  However, even with a free press or organised unions there are issues in space that do not arise on Earth \u2013 particularly when companies are involved.  \u201cAs we know private corporations can be just as ruthless and despotic as the worst governments,\u201d says Cockell. \u201cIf you strike, then maybe the corporation says \u2018that\u2019s fine \u2013 let me show you to the airlock and you can leave\u2019 and off you go into the vacuum of space.\u201d  And while freedoms, liberties and labour laws have evolved on Earth \u2013\u00a0at least in democratic nations \u2013 they may need to be adapted before anyone settles elsewhere. Space is a unique environment and there is a balance to be struck between slavery and total freedom. Opting out is not an option. A Martian colony that is so libertarian that everyone sits around doing nothing all day is unlikely to survive for long.  \u201cWe need to arrive at a balance between a society that maximises civil liberties but also maximises the potential for people to survive the lethal conditions of space,\u201d says Cockell.  **Sci-fi signposts   **  Although this may be one of the few times that academics have formally contemplated the challenges of off-planet living, science fiction writers have been thinking about it for decades.  One of the British Interplanetary Society\u2019s most famous members is Arthur C Clarke and conference delegates include one of today\u2019s best-known and acclaimed sci-fi writers, Stephen Baxter.  Baxter\u2019s 2010 novel Ark, for instance, features a starship on a multi- generational mission to a distant new world where precisely the issues of governance arise. \u201cYou have a group of young very competitive candidates applying to get on this thing,\u201d explains Baxter, \u201cand then they find they\u2019re stuck there.\u201d  \u201cAt first it\u2019s military discipline, then they go for a consensual government but that breaks down and a dictator takes over because he gets hold of the water supply \u2013 very relevant to this discussion,\u201d Baxter says. \u201cYou also have a middle generation who are going to live and die on the ship and they evolve a rebellious teenage culture.\u201d Some people do not even believe they are on a spaceship but in some sort of prison or social experiment.  \u201cEvolving a society inside a box is a fascinating area to think about,\u201d says Baxter. \u201cSci-fi writers are always thinking one step beyond, it\u2019s a great bed of thought experiments.\u201d  > The more you anticipate, the more chance you have to get it right - Stephen Baxter  In fact one of the first known books on lunar revolution, The Birth of a New Republic, was written by sci-fi author Jack Williamson in the 1930s. The novel explores tensions within society and between the Moon and Earth. Robert Heinlein\u2019s 1966 novel, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, even explores the idea of a prison colony on the Moon with a despotic prison warder who controls the air supply.  For Baxter, the conference helps shift these sci-fi ideas into practical reality.  \u201cThe more you anticipate, the more chance you have to get it right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that far away before we have long-term missions away from the Earth and we have to look at the psychology of people in enclosed environments and construct a civilisation on this basis.\u201d  In the 1930s a colony on the Moon was a distant dream. Even in 1966 humanity was three years away from that first step. A long duration mission could happen during our lifetime. If it is to succeed and humans are to successfully colonise new worlds, we need to be prepared.  _Follow us on __Facebook__, __Google+__ or __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - How to overthrow a Martian dictatorship", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150619-how-to-overthrow-a-martian-dictatorship", "countriesMentioned": ["United Kingdom", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa", "Australia"], "author": "Richard Hollingham"},{"newsText": "Professor Johann-Dietrich Woerner has been in his new job as Director General of the European Space Agency (Esa) for a week. In charge of a \u20ac4.4 billion annual budget, the former Chair of the German space agency is ultimately responsible for everything at Esa. Europe\u2019s new observation, weather, communication and navigation satellites; astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS); missions to Mars, Mercury and Jupiter; and a sleepy lander on a duck-shaped comet all come under his remit.  When I ask him about his intentions for Esa, I expect a predictable and politically nuanced answer about the economic and social benefits of space or maybe the importance for science of exploring the unknown Universe. Instead, Woerner surprises me with a vision for a future of space exploration that is both ambitious and audacious.  \u201cWe should look to the future beyond the International Space Station,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe should look for a smaller spacecraft in low-Earth orbit for microgravity research and I propose a Moon village on the far side of the Moon.\u201d  Yes, a village on the Moon.  > A Moon village shouldn\u2019t just mean some houses, a church and a town hall \u2013 Johann-Dietrich Woerner  Just the sort of daring vision that took Nasa from a standing start to the Moon in the 1960s, but today \u2013 possibly constrained by its political masters \u2013 the US space agency appears to be lacking ambition.  \u201cA Moon village shouldn\u2019t just mean some houses, a church and a town hall,\u201d says Woerner. \u201cThis Moon village should mean partners from all over the world contributing to this community with robotic and astronaut missions and support communication satellites.\u201d  **3D printer**  There are good reasons, he says, for going back to the Moon for science as well as using it a stepping-stone to further human exploration of the Solar System.  \u201cThe far side of the Moon is very interesting because we could have telescopes looking deep into the Universe, we could do lunar science on the Moon and the international aspect is very special,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe Americans are looking to go to Mars very soon \u2013 and I don\u2019t see how we can do that \u2013 before going to Mars we should test what we could do on Mars on the Moon.\u201d  For example, Woerner suggests, the technology being investigated by Nasa to construct a Mars base using a giant 3D printer would be better tried out on the Moon first. Learning to live on an alien world is going to be tough \u2013 but the challenge would be a lot easier, particularly in an emergency, if the extraterrestrial community is only four days away from Earth rather than six months.  Woerner envisages his Moon village as a multinational settlement involving astronauts, Russian cosmonauts and maybe even Chinese taikonauts. This would considerably extend the relatively limited number of nations involved in the ISS.  \u201cWe should have international cooperation, without any limitations, with any countries of the world,\u201d says Woerner. \u201cWe have enough Earthly problems between different nations \u2013 space can bridge these Earthly problems and the Moon seems to be to be a good proposal.  > Experience shows that there is no wall between exploration and practical applications  \u201cIsolating a country is not the right way, a much better solution is to find ways to cooperate in space to strengthen ties between humans on Earth,\u201d he adds, in what could be taken as a veiled criticism of America\u2019s refusal to engage with the Chinese space programme. \u201cIf you think about an alien visiting the Earth and seeing what we are doing here, I\u2019m not sure whether they would land.\u201d  **Moon in vogue?**  Woerner has a robust response for those who criticise money spent on space exploration and astronomical research.  \u201cExperience shows that there is no wall between exploration and practical applications,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at the greenhouse effect \u2013 everyone knows what it is and we use satellites to investigate it \u2013 but this was not discovered on Earth, it was discovered by an exploration mission to Venus.\u201d  Right now the Moon village idea is just that; an idea, a proposal. No nation or agency has committed any money or mapped out the concept in any detail.  There is, however, growing interest in returning to the Moon. When, for instance, BBC Future recently asked experts to predict the next decade of space exploration they all cited the Moon as a destination of choice.  Woerner says he is voicing the idea of a Moon village to encourage discussion about the future of space research, exploration and the applications of space technology. \u201cI will be very happy if someone else has a better idea,\u201d he tells me.  Nevertheless, as one of the world\u2019s most senior and powerful space figures, Woerner\u2019s proposal will be taken seriously. Nasa is still vague about where it plans to fly its new Orion spacecraft \u2013 fitted incidentally with an Esa service module \u2013 and the Moon would seem to be a suitably inspirational destination.  \u201cIn our genes there is something beyond just practical applications,\u201d Woerner says. \u201cWe like to discover, to pioneer \u2013 this is humankind and this is what brings us into the future.\u201d  _Follow us_ _on_\u00a0_**Facebook**__, __**Twitter**_, _**Google+**_ and _**LinkedIn**_.__", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Should we build a village on the Moon?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150712-should-we-build-a-village-on-the-moon", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "Richard Hollingham"},{"newsText": "A special kind of noisiness accosts passengers waiting for New York City subways.

Foy, for one, did find his ultimate silent spot in the end, but it wasn\u2019t quite the peaceful refuge he anticipated \u2013 in fact, he discovered there that there\u2019s one human noise none of us can ever escape.  Sit still for a moment, and prick up your ears. What can you hear? Even in what seems like silence: you may soon notice the hum of your computer, the ticking of a clock, the electric burr of a refrigerator or an air conditioner, or the faint hum of a car passing by. Humanity\u2019s noises are always with us in one form or another.  So if you were seeking to escape this background buzz, where would you start? First let\u2019s assume that you\u2019d want somewhere reasonably pleasant to visit. So while deep underground might be an option, it wouldn\u2019t be very hospitable. Similarly, life underwater would be full of hardships \u2013 and in any case, you couldn\u2019t escape man-made sounds like scuba regulators or submarine engines because you\u2019d need them to stay alive. That\u2019s not to mention the underwater rumblings of ships, drilling and explosions that permeate the worlds\u2019 oceans. In water, sound travels more than four times faster than in air, and reaches further.  **Silent checklist**  On land, scratching noisy places off the list of potentials comes easily. Satellite images can be used to exclude all areas with artificial light. Google Earth further reveals timber operations, mining, agriculture, roads and nautical shipping routes \u2013 all, presumably, rife with noise.  Following this logic, Antarctica immediately comes to mind as a promising candidate. It no doubt has silent corners \u2013 but the seasons do make things tricky. In the winter, you wouldn\u2019t want to go for a stroll. And in the summer, research planes and tourism boats are prevalent, and resident scientists power their camps with whirring diesel generators, the rumble of which can be heard for 20 miles or more around.  Other apparently remote regions of Earth might prove no better. Planes are the primary culprits. The rumblings of the largest aircraft can, on a clear day, travel up to 160km (100 miles). There is no altitude that a commercial jet can fly at which it is not audible on the ground, and the sound of any given aircraft can be heard, on average, between three to eight minutes as it passes overhead.  While no commercial flights travel across Antarctica, they do cruise over wildernesses such as northern Canada, Siberia or the Sahara. The North Pole is out too, as planes regularly traverse that route on trips between North America and Europe. Even deep in the Amazon rainforest, 1,900 km (1,200 miles) from the nearest city, Gordon Hempton, an acoustic ecologist and founder of the non\u2013profit One Square Inch, recorded sounds from one or two aircraft per hour. \u201cEven if you are far from a road, you are not far from the roads in the sky,\u201d he says.  Unfortunately, Hempton says that there is absolutely no place on Earth that is completely free from human sound all of the time. A map of the established flight paths over the US, for example, \u201clooks like a plate of spaghetti,\u201d he says.  Hempton is not alone in this pronouncement. \u201cThere are no places on Earth that I\u2019ve been that haven\u2019t been affected by human sound,\u201d agrees Bernie Krause, an expert in bioacoustics and one of the founders of the field of soundscape ecology. \u201cAll over the Earth, not a day goes by when you don\u2019t hear something.\u201d   **   Quiet winners   **   Given the lack of truly silent places in nature, identifying the quietest place on Earth really boils down to how stringent you are about how long silence should last. Several years ago, the Campaign to Protect Rural England declared a spot in Northumberland the most tranquil place in the country. One of the reasons that idyllic refuge is so quiet, however, is its location just next to a military training area. Away from all roads and accessible only by foot or mountain bike, that corner of the country is indeed very silent \u2013 except when tanks are rumbling across the base and soldiers are practicing on the firing range. \u201cIf you go on a training day, it\u2019s anything but tranquil,\u201d says Trevor Cox, a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford.  For the past 30 years, Hempton has made it his mission to discover what he calls the last great quiet places, areas that clock in at audible human noise- free intervals of 15 minutes or more. He only counts areas of around 3,100 square kilometres (1,200 square miles) or larger \u2013 enough to create a sound buffer around a central point of absolute quiet. Over the years, his list has shrunk as he returns to a previously quiet spot, only to find it now polluted by noise. Still, he says 12 such quiet places exist in the US, with more found around the world. A spot in the Hoh Rainforest in Washington is one, as are places in Grasslands National Park in Canada, Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota and Haleakala National Park in Hawaii (see gallery). The others, however, he keeps confidential.  Although his search has focused on the US, he has investigated quiet places abroad, too. Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Austria and most developed parts of Europe and Asia have all been ruled out. On the other hand, he identified a quiet place deep in the Ecuadorian rainforest, and there are others in South America. He suspects one might exist in Poland (he\u2019s waiting on funding to come through to further investigate this possibility), and also more in Norway, Sweden and Finland.  Hempton and Krause hope that nations will adopt a quiet area program akin to dark sky programs. They are pushing for the US National Park Service to adopt such regulations in 2016, in time for the agency\u2019s centennial. \u201cI absolutely believe we will have our quiet places,\u201d Hempton says. \u201cJust like we went through with water quality, things have to get really bad before we recognise them as a basic value and clean them up.\u201d **   **   Yet for those seeking absolute relief from human noise for an indefinite period, the surest bet would finding one of the rooms specifically built for that purpose, called anechoic chambers. They are both sound proof and sound wave-absorbing. That was the conclusion reached by Foy, at least, after he visited such a chamber at Orfield Labs in Minnesota. It measures at \u20139.4 decibels, a figure less than zero decibels because any sound that does exist is below what the human ear can detect. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be the quietest place on earth,\u201d he says.  Where others tend to become uncomfortable in the disconcerting silence, Foy relished the chance to be completely cut off. But minutes into his stay in the chamber, he noticed that the silence was in fact broken. His own body, it turned out \u2013 his breathing, his heartbeat, even the scratchy sound his scalp made rubbing against his skull when he frowned \u2013 was betraying his quest for auditory nothingness. \u201cThe only time you\u2019ll hear absolute silence is when you\u2019re in no position to hear it, because you\u2019re dead,\u201d he realized.  The quietest places in the world, then, are ones we have built, and yet, so long as we are living, we will never escape the noise of our own bodies.  On the other hand, given the discomfort that many report experiencing in absolute silence, it may instead be nature\u2019s melodies that our souls are really craving. And for now, it\u2019s still possible to find forests, seashores or mountains where you can relax for 15 minutes or more completely free from the clatter of human existence. If you find one of these serene sweet spots, however, it might be best to keep it quietly to yourself.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The last place on Earth without human noise", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140117-earths-last-place-without-noise", "countriesMentioned": ["Canada", "Poland", "Finland", "Sweden", "France", "Antarctica", "Switzerland", "Norway", "Spain", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "author": "Rachel Nuwer"},{"newsText": "![Rex Tillerson testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing to become US Secretary of State on Capitol Hill in Washington, 11 January](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A9FE/production/_93781534_mediaitem93781528.jpg) Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Tillerson is the former chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has narrowly approved Rex Tillerson as US secretary of state, despite concerns about his business ties to Russia.  It split along party lines, with all 11 Republicans voting in favour and all 10 Democrats against. A full vote will now be held in the Republican-run Senate.  The move capped a busy day for the new Donald Trump administration.  Most notable was the US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fulfilling a campaign pledge.  President Trump signed an executive order to pull out from the 12-nation trade deal that had been a linchpin of former President Barack Obama's Asia policy.  \"Great thing for the American worker what we just did,\" Mr Trump said.  At the start of his first full week in office, the president also:    * banned funding for international groups that promote abortions   * froze the hiring of some federal workers   * met corporate bosses and warned of border taxes levied on firms that outsource   * picked Ajit Pai - a critic of \"net neutrality\" rules - to head the Federal Communications Commissions   * blamed illegal ballots for his failure to win the popular vote, without offering evidence   * promised to have a new Supreme Court nominee within two weeks  Also on Monday, the Senate confirmed Mike Pompeo as Mr Trump's CIA director.

Mr Rubio said that although he had doubts over the choice, he believed a new president was entitled to deference in assembling his cabinet.  \"Despite my reservations, I will support Mr Tillerson's nomination in committee and in the full Senate,\" said Mr Rubio.  He had challenged Mr Tillerson over his refusal to call President Putin a \"war criminal\" over Russia's air strikes in Syria and his failure to condemn strongly enough human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.  Mr Rubio was among the candidates who fought Mr Trump in the battle for the Republican presidential ticket.  The partisan split in the voting is unusual. Traditionally, nominees for secretary of state have been approved by overwhelming votes from both parties.  Senator Ben Cardin, the committee's top Democrat, had said he would not vote for Mr Tillerson, also over his position on Russia as well as other issues.  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p04p8vjz.jpg)  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionAre Trump's nominees on the same page on Russia as their boss?  He also suggested that Mr Tillerson's \"business orientation\" could \"compromise his ability as secretary of state to forcefully promote the values and ideals that have defined\" America.  While critics raise concern about his ability to trade in his corporate interest for a national one, some supporters suggest the former CEO's background as a global dealmaker may bring fresh perspective to the nation's top diplomatic post.  At a closed doors meeting on Monday night, Mr Trump told congressional leaders he would have won the popular vote in the election if millions of undocumented immigrants had not voted illegally. He gave no evidence for the claim.  Democrat Hillary Clinton won nearly three million votes more than her opponent, who got more support in key swing states and won the electoral college.

Barack Obama's policies on technology were considered pro-innovation, with a view to using technology expertise to improve government systems and services.  Aside from a disastrous and expensive roll-out of healthcare.gov, those efforts appear to have been well-received.  With Mr Trump, the future leaves many uncertainties. While we can draw a lot from what he has said in the past, more difficult is separating freewheeling campaigning Trump from measured, lawmaking Trump.  Much of the detail below comes from research carried out by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a US-based non-profit group.  It pulled together a report on what Mr Trump has said and pledged when it comes to technology. When lacking in specifics, the report authors drew from attitudes in other areas in an attempt to predict what may happen. You can read the report for yourself here.  ## Privacy and encryption  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple boss Tim Cook may find himself at odds with Mr Trump's views on security  **The issue:**  In the wake of the shootings in San Bernardino, the FBI called on Apple to weaken the encryption on its iPhone in order to assist the investigation into the shooters. The company refused, saying the personal privacy of its users should take precedent. That stance was backed by the majority of the tech community, but not by Mr Trump. User privacy when using technology is a battleground that will continually rear its head during Mr Trump's term. Today many people are concerned about his views on the surveillance state.  **In his own words:**  _\"Boycott Apple until such time as they give that information.\" (Campaign rally, February 2016)_  _\"I would come down so hard on [Apple chief executive Tim Cook] his head would be spinning all of the way back to Silicon Valley.\" (Bloomberg interview, February 2016)_  The call to boycott Apple over the encryption row seemed very much in the heat of the moment. Indeed, Mr Trump said \"I just thought of that\" during the rally. It wasn't a boycott that was taken seriously - even tweets on Mr Trump's Twitter account were shown to have come from Apple devices (even if Mr Trump himself is understood to use an Android device).  When speaking about the controversial power of the NSA and its surveillance capabilities, Mr Trump said:  _\"I assume when I pick up my telephone, people are listening to my conversations anyway, if you want to know the truth. It's pretty sad commentary, but I err on the side of security. When you have people that are beheading [you] if you're a Christian and, frankly, for lots of other reasons, when you have the world looking at us and would like to destroy us as quickly as possible, I err on the side of security.\" (Speaking on Hugh Hewitt radio show, December 2015)_  **What it means:**  We don't really know. Attitudes towards \"America First\" and support of the military might have assumptions leaning towards Mr Trump at least maintaining the power of the security services in the US, but we're yet to hear firm policy on the specifics. Mr Trump has said he wants to restore the Patriot Act at which, among other things, used to give the NSA powers to collect bulk data on American's phone records until that power was taken away by Congress. As with previous administrations, we can expect the war on terror to be the primary justification for these powers to exist. When it comes to encryption, the Apple row gave Mr Trump a chance to make his thoughts perfectly clear, and while the boycott may have been flippant, his attitudes seem firmly set on supposed security over privacy.  ## Bringing foreign talent to Silicon Valley  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sundar Pichai, born in India, rose to be the chief executive of Google  **The issue:**  One point of concern for tech firms is the future of the H1-B visa.  The H1-B is considered vital for technology companies that want to fill their ranks with skilled developers and engineers. It's a temporary residency, but companies can choose to sponsor employees to remain in the US indefinitely.  **In his own words:**  _\"I know the H-1B very well. And it's something that I, frankly, use, and I shouldn't be allowed to use it. We shouldn't have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do. When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. It's very bad for business in terms of \u2014 and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it.\" (CNN Republican debate, March 2016)_  Mr Trump has been seen to have done a U-turn. He seems to believe the H1-B visa is being abused to bring in cheaper labour, rather than skilled labour. He cited an example in Florida where he said American workers at a Disney theme park were being forced to train their cheaper, foreign replacements.  **What it means:**  Mr Trump is in favour of highly-skilled immigration, particularly when immigrants have come in to study at top US colleges. It seems likely he will either alter or abolish the H1-B visa and attempt to enforce an alternative that clamps down on what he sees as abuses of the current system.  ## America's readiness for cyberwar  Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Researchers predict a major cyberattack within first 100 days of Mr Trump's presidency  **The issue:**  Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, more powerful, and more dangerous. Forrester Research on Wednesday predicted that \"within the first 100 days, the new president will face a cybercrisis\".  And so while much debate in the run up to the election was about Mr Trump's possible control of the nuclear codes, there've been questions over how he'd handle the growing cyber threat from the likes of China, Russia and stateless hacking groups.  **In his own words:**  _\"It is a huge problem. I have a son - he's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers. It's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe, it's hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better. And certainly cyber is one of them.\" (Presidential debate, September 2016)_  The quote above was widely mocked as being utterly incoherent. The New York Daily News called it \"an out-of-touch comment that would come from your tech- illiterate grandpa\".  Mr Trump was also reluctant to follow the FBI's lead in blaming Russia for hacking the Democratic National Convention \\- one of several cyberattacks that were arguably pivotal in winning the race for Mr Trump.  But Mr Trump certainly wouldn't be the first person in power to have a lacklustre understanding of how technology works, and so it's broad policy rather than expertise that is most important.  **What it means:**  Unlike traditional war, where observers can see jets in the sky or tanks rolling across land, cyberwar is much harder to track. It may be that we never learn Mr Trump's precise thoughts on the USA's cyberattack capabilities, and they could be enacted in secret.  His campaign website provides vague descriptions of what his administration would do, including an \"immediate review of all US cyber defences and vulnerabilities\".  He's also said he wanted to develop the US's offensive capabilities so the country could retaliate against cyberattack. This wouldn't be unprecedented as cyberweapons have been used by the US in the past.  ## Net Neutrality  Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Mr Trump appeared confused by what net neutrality represents  **The issue:**  For some time a debate has raged over the control of internet traffic. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have called for the ability to provide what would essentially be an internet fast-lane for major, data-intensive services like Netflix. The ISPs would seek to charge the companies to be on this fast- lane, a move described by most in the technology community as extremely anticompetitive and against the spirit of the internet itself. As it stands, we have net neutrality - all traffic on the internet is treated equally.  **In his own words:**  _\"Obama's attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target the conservative media.\" (Twitter, August 2016)_  This statement appeared to display a deep ignorance of what net neutrality is. The Fairness Doctrine was a policy in the US which required broadcasters to present a range of views on important topics, like politics. It was overturned in 1987, allowing TV channels to push forward whatever view they want (and the rest is history). Mr Trump's linking of the Fairness Doctrine to Net Neutrality is baffling, as strong net neutrality would favour more views beyond the mainstream media he loves to hate.  **What it means:**  If we take the above tweet as evidence that Mr Trump has probably not spent much time considering Net Neutrality, then it's fair to say it's probably not at the forefront of his mind and therefore not high on his list of priorities once taking office. Lower down the pecking order, the US court system has come out in favour of neutrality principles.  ## The AT&amp;T-Time Warner mega-deal  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption CNN's Anderson Cooper working for a channel that may soon be owned by AT&amp;T  **The issue:**  Telecoms giant AT&amp;T is set to buy Time Warner, thus becoming even more giant.  **In his own words:**  _\"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&amp;T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" (Speech, October 2016)_  It's a fair point about a large concentration of power. AT&amp;T would not only control the biggest network providing information to the masses, but also much of the content they were creating and broadcasting. Time Warner owns HBO and Warner Bros, not to mention CNN, a news outlet attacked repeatedly by Mr Trump and his supporters during campaigning.  AT&amp;T-Time Warner isn't the only deal he's taken aim at, either:  _\"Comcast's purchase of NBC concentrated far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do. Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that. That should never, ever have been approved in the first place, they're trying to poison the mind of the American voter.\" (Speech, October 2016)_  **What it means:**  Another \"wait and see\", unfortunately. At this point, there's just no way of deciphering whether Campaign Trump is the same as President Trump.  If Mr Trump did want to follow through on his words, it wouldn't simply be a case of stepping in and calling a halt. It would be a long, expensive process through the courts that would make Mr Trump look distinctly anti-business. This would especially be the case if the government went after Comcast some five years after it bought NBC.  On Wednesday AT&amp;T offered an olive branch with this rather flattering statement: \"From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his transition team.  \"His policies and his discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&amp;T's goals.\"  ## Amazon's future  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jeff Bezos might come to regret mocking Mr Trump on Twitter  **This issue:**  If Mr Trump and Jeff Bezos were rappers, you'd call this a \"beef\".  Mr Trump has made no effort to hide his disdain for Mr Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon.  Mr Bezos also owns the Washington Post, the newspaper that perhaps did more than any other to take on Mr Trump's campaign.  The newspaper was the first to publish the infamous video of Mr Trump making disparaging remarks about women and bragging about sexual assault.  Mr Trump considers Amazon to be a company that is avoiding tax and is anti- competitive.  **In his own words:**  _\"Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. [Bezos is] using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.\" (Sean Hannity Show, Fox News, May 2016)_  In various tweets, Mr Trump also suggested that Mr Bezos was using the Washington Post, which like many newspapers loses money, as a way of reducing Amazon's tax bill. However, the Washington Post isn't part of Amazon - it's a company Mr Bezos owns privately, so such a move would not be possible.  That said, Amazon is part of a technology collective that goes to great lengths to pay as little tax as possible, prompting law changes in several parts of the world.  Ironically, using big losses as a way to avoid paying taxes is precisely what Mr Trump has done for much of his professional life, a move he said made him \"smart\".  **What it means:**  Mr Trump's tweets were an example of the next president taking the bait. The insults followed Mr Bezos saying he'd gladly fund a rocket that would take Mr Trump on a one-way trip into space.  So while Mr Bezos may now regret starting the #SendDonaldToSpace hashtag, we don't know if Mr Trump will see through his threat to single out Amazon. What's more likely is a clamp down on tax avoidance across the board, with a likely focus on the myriad inventive ways tech companies relocate their earnings.  Regardless, Amazon's stock dropped on Wednesday in anticipation for what might be on the horizon. While other tech stocks also went down, none were quite as pronounced as Amazon.  ## The future of energy tech  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Elon Musk's company has benefitted from government subsidies  **The issue:**  A key area of growth in the US is in renewable energies and businesses built around it. But to accelerate growth of companies like Tesla, the US government has long offered attractive subsidies as a way of tempting in customers who ordinarily could not afford renewable energy.  **In his own words:**  _\"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" (Twitter, November 2012)_  One of Mr Trump's strongest areas of support was in the so-called coal country area, traditionally populated by coal mines and industries. The region has suffered as concern about climate change pushed governments to embrace renewable energy instead.  Mr Trump turned that on its head by calling climate change a hoax, playing to a crowd that would not notice, nor care, about the incremental changes in climate the Earth is going through.  **What it means:**  Mr Trump has pledged to \"unleash America's $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves\", and the money for it may in part come from ditching subsidies offered to renewable energy efforts.  It may mean that tax credits given to people buying electric cars are no longer be offered. At the moment, a Tesla Model 3, for instance, is reduced from $35,000 to $27,500 when tax credits are factored in.  In the immediate future, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who said Mr Trump was \"not the right guy\" for the White House, may have a even tougher job convincing Tesla shareholders to push forward with his plan to buy solar panel company SolarCity. The vote on that takes place later this month.  Image copyright Getty Images  ## What all of this means together...  Uncertainty, frustration and an increased fragility for the global home of tech innovation.  Mr Trump certainly won't want to go down as the president who destroyed Silicon Valley, but the concern here is that of the few policies that have been explained in detail, some seem directly at odds with each other.  How do you promote \"great\" American companies which provide jobs, while simultaneously dragging Amazon, a massive employer and innovator, through the courts? How do you protect innovation at Tesla when taking aim at efforts to curb climate change?  Silicon Valley may be in America, but it's by no means an entirely American success story. The region's success grew out of being an attractive, progressive destination for the best brains in the world.

Most of us would probably answer \u201cnot very thrilled\u201d. But Frank Stephenson\u2019s boss is not your average boss; his workplace is not your average workplace; and the fish? Well, that\u2019s not your normal fish either.  Stephenson is design director of McLaren Automotive, the carmakers behind a range of highly prized, high-priced cars. While on holiday in the Caribbean, he noticed a sailfish on a wall in the resort where he was staying. A man working there told Stephenson that he was proud to have caught the fish because it was so fast. Stephenson was intrigued \u2013 he began doing some research on the species to find out why it was so quick.  On the way back to London, Stephenson stopped off in Miami and went down to a local fishing village, where, in a stroke of luck, a local fisherman had just caught a sailfish. He bought it, sent it downtown to get it stuffed and eventually got it delivered to the scanning department of the McLaren Automotive aerodynamics laboratory in Surrey \u2013 where the carmakers set to work trying to learn the secrets of the super-speed fish\u2019s abilities. It\u2019s just one of a number of recent initiatives by automotive companies to try and learn from techniques that have been used in nature.  The sailfish is a kind of turbo swordfish; one that has been clocked swimming 100m in around half the time it takes Usain Bolt to run it. They are capable of these bursts of breath-taking speed in order to chase down the small, fast- swimming fish they eat. The analysis revealed that the scales on the sailfish\u2019s skin generate little vortices that result in the fish being enveloped in a bubble of air instead of denser water. This reduced drag allows the fish to move even faster.  **Evolutionary design**  McLaren\u2019s designers applied the same texture as the scales of the sailfish to the inside of the ducts that lead into the engine of their P1 hypercar. This increased the volume of air going into the engine by 17%, improving the car\u2019s efficiency: the P1 has hybrid engines creating 903\u00a0horsepower and thus needs large amounts of air pumped into the engine to help combustion and engine cooling.  The P1 also borrowed from the sailfish little \u2018diplets\u2019 on the torso of the fin where it meets the tail fin that the fish uses to straighten out the flow of pockets of air and water that move past it. This, Stephenson says, made the car more aerodynamic.  Nature has had millions of years to evolve its designs, says Stephenson, which is why he is trying to incorporate those tricks into his projects. \u201cIt just simply makes sense,\u201d he says. \u201cHow can a lizard go upside down and stick to the surface for example? Well, if you can find out why, you can just apply that technology to the tyres of the car such that when the surfaces are wet, there\u2019s no way that the car can slide.\u201d  Hydrodynamic principles have often been refined by nature long before humans discovered them. For example, engineers from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have recently developed an air lubrication system that separates water from the surface of ships to reduce drag up to 80%; gas is not as dense as water, so the ships has less friction and glides more easily. This is a similar technique to that used by the sailfish. And it turns out it\u2019s just as useful on land as it is in the water.  **Boxfish brainwave**  The McLaren design studio is a mix of science lab, art workshop and music rehearsal space.\u00a0 Its aim is to help designers gain a cutting edge, by taking them out of their comfort zone. \u201cEveryday I\u2019m doing research in my office, it looks like I\u2019m studying biology in my office rather than car design,\u201d says Stephenson.  McLaren have some company in this biomimicry department. Mercedes Benz\u2019s bionic car was inspired by a boxfish with hexagonal plates on its outer skin which is like a \u201csuit of armour\u201d, giving the fish rigidity, protection and manoeuvrability. The cube-shaped structure doesn\u2019t create drag; by mimicking this boxy shape, engineers were able to achieve a record-breaking drag coefficient \u2013 a value used to quantify the amount of resistance an object faces whilst trying to move through air or water. The Mercedes Benz engineers also managed to lower fuel consumption by 20%, and lessen nitrogen oxide emissions by 80%.  Japanese carmaker Nissan, on their quest to create the ultimate collision-free vehicles, have created small \u201ccute\u201d robots called Eporo, which also feature tricks learned from creatures living beneath the waves. \u201cWe needed to look no further than Mother Nature to find the ultimate form of collision-avoidance systems in action, in particular, the behavioural patterns of fish,\u201d says Toru Futami, the engineering director of advanced technology and research. The movement of fish, which move in schools and avoid obstacles en masse, is the elementary principle of the algorithm that the locomotion of the robots is built on. \u201cThis algorithm is very simple,\u201d adds Susumu Fujita, the co-creator of Eporo.  \u201cFish follow these three rules: Don\u2019t go too far, don\u2019t get too close and don\u2019t hit each other\u201d explains Futami. The robots have already inspired features in Nissan cars including Intelligent Brake Assist (IBA) and Forward Collision Warning (FCW). These are the bases that the new autonomous cars could be built on, eliminating the need for lanes, traffic lights and even indicators. Even some car parts could become obsolete. \u201cWe have systems that are going to eliminate the need for windscreen wipers \u2013 you don\u2019t see animals with windscreen wipers on their eyes,\u201d asserts Stephenson.  Of course, not all inspiration comes from underwater. The Eporo, for example, contain Laser Range Finder (LRF) technology that was developed in a previous project from Nissan. It is inspired by the way a bumblebee can detect objects across a wide range, and can sense obstacles up to two metres away in a 180-degree radius. If one is detected, the robot is able to turn its wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.  Biomimicry has become a watchword for many car companies, but nature\u2019s secrets are also having an effect off the road. Recently, Nasa also asked members of the public to select a spacesuit for the future, one of which\u00a0 was inspired by \u201cthe scaly skin of fish and reptiles\u201d.  Increasingly, designers are finding that nature\u2019s tricks can surpass their own ideas. And so it makes sense to seek that inspiration from anywhere \u2013 even a stuffed sailfish on the wall of a resort in the Caribbean.  _Video produced by Dalmeet Singh Chawla, recording by Van Le.

The Sumatran rhino had dropped too much weight over the summer. By December, she had stopped playing with her toys and became even more reclusive and lethargic.  For nearly a decade, her keepers at Cincinnati Zoo had watched her grow. They had big plans for her. Suci, whose very name means \u2018sacred individual\u2019 in Indonesian, was to be a saviour of her species. There are only around 100 Sumatran rhinos left, so a plan was hatched to mate Suci with her brother Harapan to increase their species\u2019 count. But now, she had iron storage disease, a condition that also killed her mother.  Hope that she would pull through came to an end one Sunday in March. Her keepers noticed that she was behaving oddly that day, so stayed with her into the night, and watched as she slipped away.  \u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s tried as hard as we did to cure a rhino of this disease,\u201d says Terri Roth, director of the Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. But still, she says, \u201cYou can\u2019t help but feel responsible that you were not able to save this animal.\u201d Suci, she explains, was one of the few promising females left for breeding. Others are too old or haven\u2019t been able to get pregnant. Even wild females are turning up infertile.  \u201cAnimals die, animals get injured,\u201d says Roth. \u201cBut when you\u2019re down to 100, it\u2019s far more than an emotional loss.\u201d  The Sumatran rhino is one of the world\u2019s rarest animals, but the bittersweet news is that we can at least identify that the species is in need of our help. For other endangered animals, it can be more difficult. Protecting the world\u2019s rarest species from extinction first requires identifying which creatures belong in this grim category. Yet answering this simple question can prove more difficult than it might seem.  First off, there is a difference between population numbers and conservation status, as reported by something like the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) Red List \u2013 the world\u2019s most comprehensive database on the subject. In theory, conservation statuses are based on pure science, but in reality human subjectivity can come into play. \u201cThe listings can be incredibly political, and very emotional,\u201d says Lisa Campbell, the Rachel Carson associate professor of marine affairs and policy at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina. Deciding whether to list an animal as critically endangered or just vulnerable could make or break funding for that creature, so there is a tendency to lean toward the direst possible listing.  Additionally, simply listing a species as critically endangered doesn\u2019t mean its rarity or chance of extinction is equal to all other creatures that share that status. Existing protection measures, types of threats, dispersal and genetic standings can all influence a species\u2019 likelihood of actually kicking the extinction bucket. Numbers can vary widely, too. Critically endangered hawksbill turtles currently number in the thousands, whereas fewer than 100 critically endangered Seychelles sheath-tailed bats still exist in the world. \u201cOne criticism is \u2018how can those be equivalent things?\u2019 There\u2019s no good answer to that,\u201d Campbell says.  So while no one is arguing that endangered species lists are bad things, if you want to identify the rarest animals on earth, it\u2019s better to go by absolute numbers alone.  In some cases, counting the total number of animals in a population can be easy. Researchers know every single remaining black stilt in New Zealand, for example. Those 27 birds are tagged and recognised like well-known friends. In other cases, it is straightforward to count the animals, such as by flying overhead to tally up African elephants. Often, though, they are stuck with less reliable methods of estimating population, such as analysing scat, counting nests or setting up camera traps. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of species where we know there\u2019s five, 20 or 100 individuals,\u201d says Mike Hoffman, senior scientific officer at the IUCN\u2019s species survival commission. \u201cBut there\u2019s a whole bunch of others that we know are highly threatened and declining quickly, but we don\u2019t actually know what their exact population size is.\u201d  \u201cSo you can come up with a list of species that are perilously close to extinction,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the complete list.\u201d  Some of the species that we do know enough about to say are among the world\u2019s rarest include the Javan rhino, already extinct in mainland Southeast Asia and currently holding out with as few as 40 individuals; the Hainan gibbon, confined to a tiny patch of forest on China\u2019s rapidly developing Hainan island and numbering 23-25 individuals; and the Yangtze giant soft shell turtle, down to only four living individuals.  Very rare species may also persist only in captivity. The Red List currently reports 32 such species. Those species \u2013 including the Kihansi spray toad, the Socorro dove, the Guam rail and the Hawaiian crow \u2013 are strong contenders for title of rarest animal.  Sometimes, attempts to return these animals to the wild prove successful, as in the case of the black-footed ferret, the California condor, the Przewalski\u2019s horse and several others. While still listed as endangered, those animals are at least playing functional roles in their environments. In other cases, however, things don\u2019t go as well.  Despite best efforts, the species might not breed or survive well in captivity (as in the case of Suci), or there may just be too few individuals left. Such was the case for the Po\u2019o-uli, a handsome Hawaiian bird whose last known individual \u2013 a lone male for whom researchers never found a mate \u2013 died in captivity in 2004. \u201cThat was it \u2013 the end of the species,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cIt was a case of too little, too late.\u201d  Another problem with identifying the world\u2019s rarest animals is the difficulty often associated with seeking out the rarest of the rare. Exceptionally scarce animals can be so elusive that scientists sometimes lose track of them altogether. This might lead to their being declared extinct, only to reemerge years later. Recently, for example, the Hula painted frog \u2013 presumed extinct \u2013 hopped out of hiding in Israel after a more than 50-year hiatus.  Prematurely declaring a species extinct can help push it over the edge to actual extinction. Budgets and conservation planning often revolve around a species presence or non-presence in an area. If it\u2019s listed as officially no longer existing, then no help will come for any lone holdouts. \u201cOne of my colleagues here coined term \u2018the Romeo effect,\u2019\u201d says Stuart Butchart, head of science for BirdLife International. \u201cIt means you give up on a species and stop trying to apply conservation measures, but it does still exist.\u201d  Because of this problem, scientists who determine conservation status listings are not quick to declare extinction, even if that might very well be the case. Miss Waldron\u2019s red colobus has not been spotted since 1978, for example, but it is still listed as critically endangered on the Red List, with the hope that a few of those animals might be hiding out in a remote corner of the Ivory Coast jungle. Likewise, BirdLife International estimates that one to seven Oahu alauahios still survive in Hawaii, despite none having been officially sighted since 1985. \u201cSome of these animals flagged as possibly extinct could very well be the world\u2019s rarest animals if they still exist,\u201d Hoffman says.  Another flaw in the list of potential rarest animals on Earth is the fact that mammals, birds and reptiles dominate it. Invertebrates, fungi and many ocean- dwelling creatures are conspicuously missing simply because their global populations and conservation statuses have never been assessed.  The IUCN has evaluated 71,576 species out of what some researchers estimate to be 8.7 million. The organisation plans to increase that count to 160,000 by 2020, but that\u2019s still just a fraction of the world\u2019s total biodiversity. \u201cDefining the rarest animal on the planet would imply surveying the entire potential distribution range of every single species, and being able to count every single individual \u2013 a formidable challenge,\u201d says Markus Gusset, chief conservation officer at the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.  This means that the world\u2019s rarest creature could in fact be some ultra- obscure beetle whose jungle plot is currently being mowed down, or an unknown crustacean whose estuary home is quickly being drained. It\u2019s simply impossible to know for sure.  The good news, however, is that conservation measures to protect better- studied species often benefit those the spotlight evades as well. According to BirdLife International, important bird areas, for example, fortuitously overlap with 80% of the areas identified as critical for amphibians, fish, invertebrates, plants and other life forms. This is where a species conservation status arguably becomes most important: as a tool for encouraging countries to step up and protect an endangered species before it is too late, and in so doing to also shield an entire ecosystem. \u201cWe have the knowledge and the tools to protect these species,\u201d Butchart says. \u201cWe just need to implement them.\u201d  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our _Facebook_ or _Google+_ page, or message us on _Twitter_._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Endangered species: The last animals of their kind", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140509-whats-the-worlds-rarest-animal", "countriesMentioned": ["Israel", "Seychelles", "United Kingdom", "Germany", "United States", "Canada", "Australia", "China", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Brazil"], "author": "Rachel Nuwer"},{"newsText": "![World-changing ideas summit](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p049vjvx.png)  Upcoming event  The World-Changing Ideas Summit  This story is part of a series inspired by the subjects and speakers appearing at BBC Future\u2019s World-Changing Ideas Summit in Sydney on 15 November.

Conceived of by a corpulent English undertaker and coffin-maker called William Banting \u2013 who was clearly well positioned to observe the consequences of over-indulgence \u2013 it became the first popular diet.  Banting advocated reduced consumption of starchy and sugary carbohydrates and up to six ounces of meat a day \u2013 but no pork, as it was thought to contain carbs \u2013 all washed down with two or three glasses of good claret.  Since Banting\u2019s time, the number of popular diets has skyrocketed. There have been any number of miracle foods, weight-loss tricks and single-ingredient solutions but how many of these have actually changed the way we eat? This is one of the questions that will be addressed at the BBC Future\u2019s World Changing Ideas Summit in Sydney in November.  **WHY ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF 'GOOD' AND 'BAD' FOOD ALWAYS CHANGING?**  It\u2019s fundamental to the nature of science that nothing is ever \u2018proved\u2019, and the same goes for dietary science. What is demonised as being bad for us one year can be redeemed the next with new research and new understanding.  Remember when eggs were considered the dietary work of the devil because of their cholesterol content? Then in 1995, a study showed that even eating two eggs a day didn\u2019t have any negative effects on the risk factors for heart disease. Eggs also contain lots of other good stuff, like protein, vitamins and minerals, so now they\u2019re very much back on the menu.  Butter also copped flak in the 1980s because of panic about cholesterol and saturated fat, and its popularity plummeted in favour of margarines. Then everyone started getting worried about man-made trans-fats in margarines, which have since been largely removed.  **IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A SUPERFOOD?**  It would be great if we could eat whatever we liked, then fix all the resulting problems with a handful of blueberries or walnuts. But our fixation with superfoods completely misses the point of healthy eating, says Rosemary Stanton, who will be speaking at BBC Future\u2019s World-Changing Ideas Summit.  \u201cThe super foods fad is yet another sign of the never-ending search for a magic bullet to solve problems,\u201d she says. \u201cSuch thinking, that ignores the multi-factorial nature of diet-related health problems, is probably the greatest myth.\u201d  The UK National Health Service agrees. In 2011 it produced a whole report debunking the idea of a miracle food, and pointing out that the best approach is to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly.  **WHAT ABOUT SO-CALLED 'FORTIFIED FOODS' AND NUTRACEUTICALS?**  Ever since we got it into our heads that certain nutrients were \u2018good\u2019 for us, the food industry has been working to produce foods that give us an extra boost of those nutrients. It might be bread fortified with folic acid or niacin, table salt with iodine, and margarine with added plant sterols or vitamin D.\u00a0 These foods tiptoe a fine line between a food and a medicine, and the addition of nutrients can mean the manufacturer is able to make health claims about the benefits of their product, which they can\u2019t necessarily make about something that isn\u2019t processed.  Stanton views this as simply a profitable distraction from the real healthy foods: fresh produce.  Oddly enough, 19th Century French chemist Marcellin Berthelot is credited with the idea of artificial food, which led to predictions of a future era of chemical food. In one article published in 1896, the author took Berthelot\u2019s ideas to the extreme, arguing that the nutrients of a steak could just as easily be absorbed in a tiny tablet, as \u201cthe pleasures of the table have ages on end been absorbing too much of the time and inclination of man and woman\u201d.  **WHAT ELSE IS IN OUR GASTRONOMIC FUTURE?**  Fans of science fiction will be familiar with the 1973 dystopian film Soylent Green, in which the population is nourished by processed food rations, including the mysterious \u2018Soylent Green\u2019. The climax of the film reveals the true ingredient (spoiler alert): people. In spite of its sinister origins \u2013 or perhaps in homage to them \u2013 Soylent is now available as an engineered product that is supposed to contain all the protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and micronutrients our bodies need, in a snack bar or drink. Although quite what is achieved by doing away with the pleasures of a crunchy apple, medium-rare steak, fresh slice of bread or strong cheddar is not clear from the marketing.  Another science fiction classic, Logan\u2019s Run, hints that all future food will come from the sea rather than from land. While the oceans already supply 16% of our total protein intake, there has long been interest in cultivating some less obvious nutrient sources from the marine environment, such as algae.  Spirulina \u2013 a type of algae \u2013 is already a staple of the health food supplement set, but interest in the wider world of sea greens is growing, with research suggesting microalgae is loaded with the right kinds of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Some are suggesting that algae would offer a much less environmentally-damaging alternative to crops.  Margaret Atwood\u2019s science fiction novel Oryx and Crake painted an unappetising vision of the future of meat, including engineered living chicken parts called ChickieNobs. But given the environmental impact of our love of a meat-heavy diet, it\u2019s no wonder that people are exploring the prospect of engineered, lab-grown meat.  But the prospect of tabletised algae, vats of cultured meat substitute or liquefied meal substitutes, all intended to supply us with the essential nutrients for life, might prompt some to question whether a life dependent on these was actually worth living.  _Join 700,000+ Future fans by liking us on_ **_Facebook_**_, or follow us on_ **_Twitter_**_,_ **_Google+_**_,_ **_LinkedIn_** _and _**_Instagram_**  _If you liked this story,\u00a0__sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter__, called \u201c__If You Only Read 6 Things This Week__\u201d.

If that happens \u2013 and it\u2019s a big if \u2013 what will become of us?  In the last few years, several high-profile voices, from Stephen Hawking to Elon Musk and Bill Gates have warned that we should be more concerned about possible dangerous outcomes of supersmart AI. And they\u2019ve put their money where their mouth is: Musk is among several billionaire backers of OpenAI, an orgnisation dedicated to developing AI that will benefit humanity.  But for many, such fears are overblown. As Andrew Ng at Stanford University, who is also chief scientist at Chinese internet giant Baidu, puts it: fearing a rise of killer robots is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.  That\u2019s not to say our increasing reliance on AI does not carry real risks, however. In fact, those risks are already here. As smart systems become involved in ever more decisions in arenas ranging from healthcare to finance to criminal justice, there is a danger that important parts of our lives are being made without sufficient scrutiny.  > AIs could have knock-on effects that we have not prepared for  What\u2019s more, AIs could have knock-on effects that we have not prepared for, such as changing our relationship with doctors to the way our neighbourhoods are policed. These are some of the issues that will be discussed at the BBC Future\u2019s World-Changing Ideas Summit in Sydney in November.  **WHAT EXACTLY IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? **  Very simply, it\u2019s machines doing things that are considered to require intelligence when humans do them: understanding natural language, recognising faces in photos, driving a car, or guessing what other books we might like based on what we have previously enjoyed reading.  It\u2019s the difference between a mechanical arm on a factory production line programmed to repeat the same basic task over and over again, and an arm that learns through trial and error how to handle different tasks by itself.  **HOW IS AI HELPING US?**  The leading approach to AI right now is machine learning, in which programs are trained to pick out and respond to patterns in large amounts of data, such as identifying a face in an image or choosing a winning move in the board game Go. This technique can be applied to all sorts of problems, such as getting computers to spot patterns in medical images, for example. Google\u2019s artificial intelligence company DeepMind are collaborating with the UK\u2019s National Health Service in a handful of projects, including ones in which their software is being taught to diagnose cancer and eye disease from patient scans. Others are using machine learning to catch early signs of conditions such as heart disease and Alzheimers.  Artificial intelligence is also being used to analyse vast amounts of molecular information looking for potential new drug candidates \u2013 a process that would take humans too long to be worth doing. Indeed, machine learning could soon be indispensable to healthcare.  Artificial intelligence can also help us manage highly complex systems such as global shipping networks. For example, the system at the heart of the Port Botany container terminal in Sydney manages the movement of thousands of shipping containers in and out of the port, controlling a fleet of automated, driverless straddle-carriers in a completely human-free zone. Similarly, in the mining industry, optimisation engines are increasingly being used to plan and coordinate the movement of a resource, such as iron ore, from initial transport on huge driverless mine trucks, to the freight trains that take the ore to port.  AIs are at work wherever you look, in industries from finance to transportation, monitoring the share market for suspicious trading activity or assisting with ground and air traffic control. They even help to keep spam out of your inbox. And this is just the beginning for artificial intelligence. As the technology advances, so too does the number of applications.  **SO WHAT\u2019S THE PROBLEM?**  Rather than worrying about a future AI takeover, the real risk is that we can put too much trust in the smart systems we are building. Recall that machine learning works by training software to spot patterns in data. Once trained, it is then put to work analysing fresh, unseen data. But when the computer spits out an answer, we are typically unable to see how it got there.  > When a computer spits out an answer, we are typically unable to see how it got there  There are obvious problems here. A system is only as good as the data it learns from. Take a system trained to learn which patients with pneumonia had a higher risk of death, so that they might be admitted to hospital. It inadvertently classified patients with asthma as being at lower risk. This was because in normal situations, people with pneumonia and a history of asthma go straight to intensive care and therefore get the kind of treatment that significantly reduces their risk of dying. The machine learning took this to mean that asthma + pneumonia = lower risk of death.    As AIs are rolled out to assess everything from your credit rating to suitability for a job you are applying for to criminals\u2019 chance of reoffending, the risks that they will sometimes get it wrong \u2013 without us necessarily knowing \u2013 get worse.  Since so much of the data that we feed AIs is imperfect, we should not expect perfect answers all the time. Recognising that is the first step in managing the risk. Decision-making processes built on top of AIs need to be made more open to scrutiny. Since we are building artificial intelligence in our own image, it is likely to be both as brilliant and as flawed as we are.  _Join 700,000+ Future fans by liking us on_ **_Facebook_**_, or follow us on_ **_Twitter_**_,_ **_Google+_**_,_ **_LinkedIn_** _and _**_Instagram_**_._  _If you liked this story,\u00a0__sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter__, called \u201c__If You Only Read 6 Things This Week__\u201d.

They were made by combining pictures from the probe\u2019s high-resolution, \u201cblack and white\u201d camera, Lorri, and its lower-resolution, colour imager known as Ralph.  The difference in hue between Pluto and Charon is clear.  But what catches the eye are four dark spots on the 2,300km-wide dwarf planet.  Each spot is about 500km across. Quite why they should be so similar in size and spacing is not clear.  Their dominant placing is on the hemisphere that New Horizons will not see during its close flyby on 14 July.  However, there should be ample opportunity to study them in the days leading up to the encounter.  \u201cIt\u2019s a real puzzle - we don\u2019t know what the spots are, and we can\u2019t wait to find out,\u201d said New Horizons principal investigator, Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute.  \u201cAlso puzzling is the longstanding and dramatic difference in the colours and appearance of Pluto compared to its darker and greyer moon Charon.\u201d  If, as scientists think, Pluto and Charon are the products of a collision between two primitive bodies in the early Solar System, one might expect them to look more similar.  New Horizon\u2019s flyby data will hopefully provide the answer.  The US space agency (Nasa) mission is now closing in on Pluto and its five moons.  The moment of closest approach on the 14th will take place at 11:49 GMT, when the probe is just 12,500km above the surface.  It is moving too fast - at 13.7km/s - to go into orbit, and it will simply scream past the dwarf and its satellites, gathering as much data as it can.  No pictures will be sent back to Earth on the day itself; the spacecraft will be too busy executing its pre-programmed observation campaign.  Instead, the first images from the flyby should be presented on the following day, on 15 July.  Controllers have decided not to alter the course of the probe.  They had been looking for icy debris in the vicinity of Pluto that might pose a collision hazard, but could find nothing obvious.  New Horizons was commanded to make a thruster burn earlier this week, to speed it up ever so slightly.  This will ensure the spacecraft reaches a precise point in space and time to carry out the pre-programmed observation sequence.  The probe must spin around to take pictures of all the different targets, and if its navigation is off by even a small amount it will be looking in the wrong direction at the critical moment.  On Thursday, New Horizons was just under 15 million km from Pluto, but 4.7 billion km from Earth.  The vast distance to the probe's home world means a radio signal takes about 4.5 hours from sending to receipt.  The BBC will be screening a special Sky At Night programme about Pluto on Monday 20 July, which will recap all the big moments from the New Horizons flyby.

You\u2019re so far up that the ground below is a sweeping panorama devoid of all detail other than the most majestic: broad rivers, mountains rising up from carpet- like plains, the silver and shimmer of sprawling cities far below. The horizon is not straight; it curves at either end.  It is the sky that really looks different, however. It is not the deep navy blue that you usually gaze at while you wait for the in-flight crew to offer you a choice of chicken or beef; here it is almost black. The stars, mostly invisible down on terra firma, sparkle in their many thousands. It\u2019s a view you have never seen before.  This is no ordinary flight. As you gaze out of the giant window that looks like the business end of one of the TIE fighters from Star Wars, the Airbuses and Boeings are plying airline routes far below you. This is one of World View Enterprises\u2019s balloons, one that the company intends to take paying passengers as high as 32 kilometres above the Earth\u2019s surface \u2013 20 miles, or 105,000ft.  These balloons are not yet a commercial concern. The company, based in Tucson, Arizona, has only carried out test flights so far. It hopes to have its first customers climb inside its capsules next year. But this is only the latest development in high-altitude ballooning, an often-forgotten part of humanity\u2019s conquest of both sky and space.  **HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN PILOTING BALLOONS?**  Ballooning offered would-be aviators a chance to ascend into the sky more than a century before the Wright Brothers first flew. Jacques Charles and Nicolas- Louis Robert piloted the first hydrogen gas-filled balloon above Paris in December 1783; Charles flew the balloon on his own later that day, climbing as high as 3,000 metres before developing earache and returning to Earth.  Though balloons were supplanted by the arrival of aircraft in the early 20th Century, they were able to soar much higher than early planes. In 1935, Captains Orvil Anderson, William Kepner and Albert Stevens took a high- altitude balloon up to 74,000ft (22.4 kilometres) \u2013 high enough that they became the first humans to see the curvature of the Earth with the naked eye. The desire to soar even higher was born.  **WHAT WERE THE CHALLENGES?**  Anderson, Kepner and Stevens made their flight in a pressurised capsule, much like those used to descend to the bottom of the sea. A decade later, in 1946, US scientist Paul Stapp believed re-breathing 100% oxygen would help high- altitude balloonists avoid the bends, and tested the theory by flying in an open gondola. Stapp\u2019s hunch was correct, and Nasa astronauts breathe the same mix of air to this day.  In 1957, David Simons became the first person to reach 100,000ft \u2013 the equivalent of 30 kilometres (18.7 miles) high. Simons\u2019 flight was intended to test the effects of spaceflight on the human body \u2013 and whether humans could survive being outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The capsule built for this flight was made by Otto Winzen, a German engineer regarded as one of the chief architects of successful high-altitude ballooning. Winzen developed an early life-support system, a way of \u201cscrubbing\u201d carbon dioxide out of the capsule\u2019s atmosphere, and a way of making sure the interior did not get too hot or too cold. Winzen\u2019s techniques allowed people to soar to the edge of space, and return to Earth without harm.  **CAN WE REALLY BALLOON TO THE EDGE OF SPACE NOW?**  In 1999, two people stayed aloft for 20 days on a non-stop balloon trip around the world. More recently, companies like World View and the Spanish-based Zero2infinity have worked towards manned \u2018edge of space\u2019 tourism flights, testing the technology by making unmanned commercial flights carrying scientific equipment. Zero2infinity plans to carry out its first passenger flight in 2018.  The most high-profile balloon flight of recent times involved one which carried Austrian adventurer Felix Baumgartner on his way to break the world\u2019s highest skydive \u2013 leaping from a balloon-tethered capsule at 127,852 ft (36.4 kilometres) above New Mexico.  Balloons may not be as attention-grabbing as the likes of Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic, but flights will be much cheaper - and passengers won\u2019t require the nerves of Felix Baumgartner.  World View plan to take five paying passengers \u2013 and two crew \u2013 up on flights that will cost some $75,000. \u201cSurrounded by viewports, you will be able to spend two hours looking down on the Earth as you float above the planet,\u201d wrote BBC Future\u2019s Richard Hollingham earlier this year. \u201cThere is even internet access on board, so you can update your Facebook status. Won\u2019t your friends just love that.\u201d  The first paying passengers will be able to gaze out at a view of our planet very few humans have seen. And the only ones with a better view are likely to be orbiting the Earth many hundreds of miles above on the International Space Station.

The measurement was made by the New Horizons probe which is just about to flyby the dwarf world.  The result means it is confirmed as the largest object yet detected in the outer zone of the Solar System known as the Kuiper Belt.  Nasa's probe is set to return a treasure trove of images and data when it sweeps past Pluto.  It is likely that in that data will be information that can further refine the object's size.  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionScientists are waiting to see what Nasa's New Horizons probe will reveal about the dwarf planet Pluto and what is beyond it  The new measurement has a number of implications. The first is that it makes Pluto slightly less dense than we thought, meaning the fraction of ice in its interior is probably higher than we had recognised.  The measurement also changes some of the expected properties of the atmosphere, given that the sphere it envelops is now considered to be larger. For modellers, it suggests the troposphere, the lowest layer, is a bit shallower.  But perhaps the main consequence from this result is what it does for Pluto fans, because it finally settles the debate over which is the bigger - Pluto or Eris?  The latter's discovery in 2005, with its comparable girth, was partly responsible for getting Pluto demoted from full planet status in 2006. However, this new result indicates that Pluto really does have the upper-hand, if only by about 30km in terms of diameter.  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionProf Alan Stern says Pluto is \"a little larger than anticipated\"  One of the reasons for past uncertainty has been the presence of that atmosphere at Pluto - something Eris does not share in such abundance. So, while scientists could be much more sure of Eris, Pluto's diameter has jumped about, depending on the assumptions made.  But New Horizons' fast-approaching cameras have put the arguments to bed.  \"Before New Horizons, we had a range from 1,150km in radius, up to a little bit north of 1,200km. And what we found is that Pluto is almost at the top of that range,\" said Prof Alan Stern, the probe's principal investigator.  The probe will pass just 12,500km above the dwarf planet on Tuesday at 11:50 GMT (12:50 BST; 07:50 EDT).  The spacecraft will be out of radio contact with Earth when that happens.  All mission controllers can do is wait for the signal from New Horizons confirming it has survived the close encounter and has all the data it was commanded to gather. This message should come through at 00:53 GMT Wednesday (01:53 BST; 20:53 EDT Tuesday).  Glen Fountain, the New Horizons project manager, has told his team to stay focused but to try also to soak up some of the atmosphere.  \"I've told the team they really need to be living the time,\" he said in a briefing to reporters.  \"I mean, how often do you get a chance like this, to realise that you are participating in something much larger than yourself?\"  New Horizons continues to downlink data on approach to Pluto. Selected pictures are being processed for public release.  Each new release brings surface features into sharper focus.  The latest postings include views of Pluto's major moon, Charon.

The mission has one opportunity to gather detailed pictures and other science data during the encounter.  The spacecraft is moving so quickly it cannot stop and will simply barrel past the little world on Tuesday.

This will include a 600-pixel-wide, full-frame image of Pluto itself.  The probe will then go radio silent. Its final contact is set for 03:17 GMT on Tuesday (04:17 BST; 23:17 EDT Monday).  Image caption Alan Stern briefing reporters on Sunday  During the hours of closest approach, when it gets to within 12,500km of the surface, New Horizons is simply too busy to talk to Earth.  The automated observation sequence will see it make hundreds of movements as it slews every which way to point its cameras, not just at Pluto and Charon, but also at the lesser moons in the system: Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.  The mission team will be waiting anxiously at its operations centre here at Johns Hopkins University for a signal confirming that the flyby was completed without incident.  This message should start to come through at 00:53 GMT Wednesday (01:53 BST; 20:53 EDT Tuesday).  All it will contain at that time will be engineering data on the status of the probe. But New Horizons' mission manager, Alice Bowman, said that just this ordinary telemetry would indicate whether all the observations were conducted as they should have been.  \"If everything looks normal, there's no reason to think we didn't get the goods,\" she told BBC News.

Nasa's Pluto probe experienced a fault on Saturday that put it temporarily out of contact with the Earth, as it speeds towards a flyby next week.  Principal investigator Alan Stern said that about 30 observations of the dwarf planet were missed as a consequence of the hiccup.  This represents \"far less than 1%\" of the top science about to come back.  \"While we would prefer that this event had not happened, I can tell you as PI that this is a speed bump in terms of the total return that we expect from this flyby,\" Prof Stern told reporters in a Monday teleconference.  ## Computer support  Launched from Earth in 2006, New Horizons is currently bearing down on Pluto and its moons at nearly 14km/s.  The probe is due to make its close approach to the dwarf on 14 July, gathering a welter of photographs and other data as it zooms past  And it was while engineers were sending up the command sequence for this observation campaign that the anomaly occurred.  The main computer tripped up, said the mission team, because it was trying to write the new information to its flash memory while at the same time attempting to compress a rich set of existing data.  The computer could not handle both tasks and New Horizons, as it is designed to, put itself in a protective mode.  This saw operations transition to the back-up computer, and a brief \u2013 just over one hour \u2013 dropout in communications with mission controllers here on Earth.  Glen Fountain, New Horizons' project manager, said the problems were very quickly diagnosed and corrected. And he was confident that the same issues could not be repeated during the flyby of Pluto.  \"These events that came together, both the compression of a lot of data and a burn to flash - those two events will not happen concurrently again. We do not do another burn to flash during the encounter,\" he explained.  ## 'Red planet'  It is in the nature of a safe mode that all unnecessary spacecraft activity is suspended, and that includes observations being made by scientific instruments.  The anomaly resulted in the loss of 6% of all observations that had been scheduled for between 4 July and 16 July.  This included 16 images from the long-range, narrow-angle camera Lorri, and four pictures from the Ralph colour camera.  But Prof Stern said the data acquired right at closest approach was the most important, and so the lost observations at the weekend amounted to far less than 1% \"by weight\" of the key science return.  Image copyright NASA Image caption When it gets to Pluto, the New Horizons probe will have a packed schedule of observations  On Monday, New Horizons was just under nine million km from Pluto, but 4.7 billion km from Earth.  The vast distance to the probe's home world means a radio signal takes about 4 hours and 25 minutes from sending to receipt.  Over the coming days, the spacecraft will send back pictures that show Pluto and its main moon, Charon, getting bigger and bigger.  Already, the far-off views are generating considerable excitement.  Pluto is seen to be reddish in colour and to have a series of mysterious spots. By comparison, Charon is grey. A lot of interest so far has centred on its dark polar cap.  The BBC will be screening a special Sky At Night programme about Pluto on Monday 20 July, which will recap all the big moments from the New Horizons flyby.

The distant object was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006, but that hasn't taken the shine off a mission which marks the beginning of a new frontier in exploration.  ## Why go to Pluto?  Pluto is the last of the nine \"classical\" planets to be visited by a space mission. Orbiting at an average of 5.9 billion km from the Sun, this tiny world appears banished, like the Roman god of the underworld whose name it bears.  But this enigmatic denizen of the icy outer reaches of the Sun's domain may have much to tell us. While the erstwhile planet and its remarkable moons hold many surprises, it may also give us a more complete appreciation of a completely unexplored region of our Solar System and yield new chapters in the story of how it unfolded.  Pluto was the last world to join the club of planets in our Solar System. In 1930, it appeared as a slow-moving speck in a series of telescope photographs. Over time, instruments have grown in power and scientists have learned more. But even when viewed through the Hubble Space Telescope, which has resolved distant galaxies, details of this icy outcast have been scant.  The best way to find out what a planet is like is to visit, which is exactly what New Horizons will do.  ## What does New Horizons hope to discover?  Image copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption The spots are part of a dark band that wraps around much of Pluto's equatorial region  Until now, scientists have had few details about Pluto's surface. The New Horizons spacecraft will be less than 8,000 miles from it at closest approach. The photographs it takes will be the first to reveal whether there are rising peaks and deep troughs or a more undulating topography.  New Horizons has already seen signs of a polar cap. Pluto is so cold that the nitrogen we breathe on Earth exists as ice, but a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere may surround the dwarf planet.  If it's there, the spacecraft will sample it and measure how much is escaping into space as it hurtles past.  And the flyby could reveal the presence of other chemical constituents: although neon is a gas on Earth, it could persist as a liquid on Pluto, perhaps even flowing in rivers across the surface. The nitrogen in the atmosphere could fall out as snow.  Another question is why Pluto's brightness changes so much - more than any other world as watched from afar. A close-up look might reveal previously unseen planetary processes.  By comparing it with the composition of Pluto's biggest moon, Charon, named after the boatman who ferried the dead to Roman underworld, the team hopes to learn more about the relationship between these two worlds.  New Horizons also hopes to find out more about Pluto's four other smaller moons: Styx; named after the river that separates the world of the living form the dead; Nix, the water spirit; Kerberos, the three-headed hell hound, and Hydra, a many-headed serpent-like creature.  Image copyright NASA Image caption The Pluto system has five known moons  Whether heavenly or hellish, Pluto and its moons are thought to originate in an outer region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper Belt that is home to hundreds of thousands of icy objects. Speaking in April at a Nasa briefing, Prof Hal Weaver, a mission scientist from Johns Hopkins University told reporters that the mission would enable scientists to probe a mysterious new realm.  \"This is our first step into this new land. This is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. When you go somewhere new you are going to learn something you couldn't even imagine and that is going to be part of the excitement of this mission,\" he said.  The probe will send back amazing high definition images, but we will all have to be patient for the data. With just a few watts of power in its transmitter - and billions of kilometres of space to traverse, the signal can only carry one kilobit of information per second. It will take 16 months for all of it to be sent.  * * *  ## Pluto: Demoted but undiminished  Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Pluto was discovered at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh    * Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh on 18 February 1930   * It is named after the Roman god of the underworld   * An average of 5.9bn km from Sun and orbits every 248 years   * Measuring its diameter is difficult but roughly 2,300km   * It has a thin nitrogen atmosphere that comes and goes  * * *  ## What will New Horizons do?  The New Horizons mission is a flypast. The probe won't land on Pluto's surface, nor will it orbit. So scientists will have to make the most of the few hours they have to gather data. The spacecraft is so far away that the sunlight falling upon it is a thousandth what it would be on Earth.  Consequently, it does not have solar panels; the spacecraft carries a plutonium generator to power all its instruments, as well as sturdy thermal blankets to keep the spacecraft warm.  Because of the four-and-a-half-hour delay in getting a signal to Pluto, the probe's instructions have been pre-programmed. Once in range of its target, the spacecraft will begin an automated sequence of measurements that have been carefully choreographed. According to Nasa's director of planetary science Jim Green, the spacecraft will only have one opportunity to gather the data so nothing has been left to chance.  \"The spacecraft is the size of a baby grand piano but is carrying a beautiful symphony of instruments with it that will play together throughout this encounter,\" he said.  \"But we are flying into the unknown and it is because of that we have to anticipate not only what we think we will observe, but also what we cannot see right now but what will be illuminated to us as we get closer and closer.  \"That means exciting new things will come about but we have to make sure that those exciting new things won't present hazards.\"  ## What could go wrong?  New Horizons could encounter clouds of particles generated by impacts on Pluto's moons. These could damage the spacecraft, which is why it will send back data as it approaches Pluto so there is something to study if the probe is later destroyed.  Such an outcome is highly unlikely, say the mission team who have modelled these possibilities. But just in case, they have designed New Horizons to have a high level of autonomy. If it encounters problems, the probe has the ability to try to recover itself and keep the mission on track.  ## So could Pluto become a planet again?  Pluto's status as a planet was revoked by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in September 2006.  The Kuiper Belt is though to be littered with small worlds like Pluto, so the IAU was faced with the choice of introducing many more planets to the Solar System - or removing Pluto.  It was a highly controversial decision that sparked public as well as academic debate. According to Prof Andrew Coates of University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), nothing that will be discovered by New Horizons is likely to change the IAU position.  \"Although a bit sad for Pluto, this shows that textbooks must be rewritten as science moves on,\" he explained.  \"But the New Horizons data from Pluto, Charon and the other moons will re- write them again as we watch. The new information will tell us more about a much larger number of objects, the building blocks of the outer Solar System.\"  Follow Pallab on Twitter.", "newsHeadline": "What will Pluto mission discover? - BBC News", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33428497", "countriesMentioned": ["Romania", "Japan", "Greece"], "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews"},{"newsText": "![The map combines images takes between 27 June and 3 July](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C73C/production/_84140015_whatsubject.jpg) Image copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption The map combines images takes between 27 June and 3 July  Scientists have released their latest map of Pluto, using images from the inbound New Horizons spacecraft.  It unwraps the visible parts of the sphere on to a flat projection, giving another view of the features that have started to emerge in recent days.  Evident are the light and dark patches at the equator, including one long dark band being dubbed \"the whale\".  The US space agency's (Nasa) New Horizons probe is now less than seven days away from its historic flyby.  It is due to pass over the surface of the dwarf planet at a distance of less than 13,000km, grabbing a mass of images and other kinds of scientific data.  The pictures at that point will be pin sharp, showing targets on the surface of the 2,300km-wide body at a resolution of better than 100m per pixel.  In the map on this page, the features are much less resolved. The images from which it was made were acquired between 27 June and 3 July.  They are a combination of shots from the probe's high-resolution, \"black and white\" camera, Lorri, and its lower-resolution, colour imager known as Ralph.  The whitish area in the centre covers the face of the dwarf planet that will present itself to New Horizons at closest approach.  To the east is the spotty terrain that has generated most discussion so far. Quite what these blobs represent is unclear. Each one is a few hundred km across.  Cradled in the whale's \"tail\", on the far left of the map, is something that looks like a doughnut. It could be a impact crater or a volcano, although at this resolution any interpretation remains pure speculation.  New Horizons has recovered from its weekend hiccup, in which the probe tripped itself into a protective safe mode and dropped communications with Earth for over an hour.  Engineers say they understand the cause of the computer glitch. This particular type of error, they stress, has now been ruled out for the probe's next few historic days.

It is moving at nearly 14km/s - far too fast to go into orbit on 14 July. Instead, it must gather as much information as it can while it sweeps past not just Pluto, but its five moons as well: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.  The flyby occurs on the 50th anniversary of the first successful American pass of Mars by the Mariner 4 spacecraft.  By way of comparison, New Horizons will gather 5,000 times as much data at Pluto than Mariner did at the Red Planet.  New Horizons' difficulty is getting all that information back to Earth.

The US space agency probe captured the latest image on Tuesday when it was just under eight million km from the dwarf world.  As of Thursday, New Horizons had moved to within six million km, heading for its historic flyby next week.  The new picture was the first to be returned following the computer hiccup at the weekend that saw the probe briefly drop communications with Earth.  The face of Pluto seen in the image is broadly that which will be examined in detail on 14 July.  It includes a large dark region near Pluto's equator, dubbed \"the whale\", and a roughly heart-shaped bright area spanning 2,000km.  ## Weird world  At closest approach, New Horizons will be about 12,500km above the surface.  Its high-resolution camera Lorri should then be able to discern features at a resolution better than 100m per pixel.  Lorri is responsible for the view seen on this page, too, but the colour information has been overlaid from the probe's other camera, Ralph.  \"They're still a little blurry but they're by far the best pictures we've ever seen of Pluto, and they're only going to get better,\" said John Spencer from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Colorado, US, one of the New Horizons co-investigators.  Image copyright Other Image caption SwRI astronomer and New Horizons team member Alex Parker tweeted this graphic  \"Right now they're just showing us that Pluto is really weird. It's got some extremely dark areas, some extremely bright areas, and we don't know what any of them are yet,\" Dr Spencer told Newshour on the BBC World Service.  He and his colleagues believe the brightest patch might be covered in frozen carbon monoxide, while the dark swathe may be a deposit of hydrocarbons, burnt out of Pluto's atmosphere by UV light and cosmic rays.  But this is all guesswork at the moment.  \"We will get pictures 500 times better than this next Tuesday, when we have our closest approach,\" Dr Spencer said.  When it arrives at the dwarf planet, New Horizons will be travelling at almost 14km/s - far too fast to go into orbit.  Instead, it will execute an automated, pre-planned reconnaissance, grabbing as many pictures and other data as it can as it barrels past the 2,300km-wide dwarf and its five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.

My reasoning was sound \u2013 provided each day I dug a little deeper it would only be a matter of time before I reached Australia. After a week I got bored and gave up.  Which is why I marvel at the Russians who did not. The ones two-and-a-half miles above Lake Vostok in the Antarctic who \u2013 despite having to brave the coldest recorded temperature on Earth \u2013 kept their gaze resolutely downwards for more than a decade, drilling a little deeper every year until just weeks ago, when they finally reached the surface of this largest and most secluded subglacial lake.  An amazing achievement... providing they haven\u2019t already gone too far and contaminated the pristine waters and fragile ecosystems it is presumed to contain. There is general agreement in much of the media coverage that its untouched waters have been cut off from the outside world for a staggering 10-20 million years \u2013 _\u201cisolated from earthly life forms since before Man existed\u201d_, as one newspaper put it.  The researchers insist they have been ultra-careful... although according to a Russian state-owned news agency they have already sampled the lake water and gifted some to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin who said it was \u201cinteresting\u201d because \u201cdinosaurs drank it\u201d. Curiouser still, the liquid was apparently yellowish.  Inevitably, given such elements, some articles have made references to Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s 100-year-old novel _The Lost World_, suggesting the tunnelling Russians could break through to find, if not actual dinosaurs, then all manner of strange creatures previously thought extinct.  A far better fictional forerunner for these eager ice burrowers is Edgar Rice Burroughs, and his novels _The Land That Time Forgot _and _The People That Time Forgot_, both filmed with dodgy special effects in the 1970s. As with _The Lost World _you get stop-motion dinosaurs still at large, but here just like Lake Vostok the long cut-off ecosystem is close to the South Pole, surrounded by ice and accessed by going under water. The tag line for one of the films was even _\u201cA lost world shut off by a wall of ice, roamed by beasts unknown to science\u201d_, which could have come straight from tabloid reports of the Russian drilling.  These and other fantasy sources all trickle into the news coverage, polluting our expectations. It seems almost churlish to point out that 10-20 million years is how long Lake Vostok has been under ice, not how long the water within it has been isolated. There is growing evidence that its contents are perpetually freezing and being replaced by water from other parts of the ice sheet melting under high pressure, and that it may be more realistic to think in terms of whatever is down there being cut off for 10-20 thousand years rather than 10-20 million.  Even if the water had been locked away untouched for 20 million years, this is nowhere near long enough for the dinosaurs mentioned by Putin to put in an appearance \u2013 they were wiped out around 65 million years ago. However, 20,000 years is still enough to mean there is a good chance of finding some unknown microbes in the lake. Drilling through the ice has already produced cores containing bacteria, fungi and algae, related to, but different from species at the surface today. Or just as intriguing would be if there is nothing \u2013 making it the only spot on Earth to have natural water without life.  Either of these, likely, findings will be a scientifically significant and a triumph over the testing conditions. It may also provide the impetus for another firm favourite of science fiction \u2013 the search for extraterrestrial life. Vostok has long been thought of as an analogue for the sub-surface oceans that exist in our solar system; in places like the Jovian moons of Europa and Ganymede. If we find life at Vostok, the thinking goes, it could give us clues for what we should look for on these extraterrestrial water worlds. And the techniques we use to explore the deep Antarctic could allow us to perfect the technology that we will require to hunt for and sample any alien creatures.  There is no mission on the cards just yet, but there have been some intriguing proposals put forward including one for a nuclear-powered \u201ccryobot\u201d to melt through the ice into the waters below. Once there, a \u201chydrobot\u201d would be deployed to sniff out our alien cousins.  If that sounds like science with a dose of fiction, think again. Prototypes of less ambitious craft have already been built and tested in the Arctic and Antarctic. And it is possible that it is the kind of technology that could eventually slip into Vostok.  If and when it does, it could calm some of the prehistoric hysterics we have read and heard over recent weeks. And maybe it will finally put an end to the kind of stories that will try to suggest the liquid given Putin was yellow because it contained urine from living dinosaurs.", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Lake Vostok: Lost world finally revealed", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120301-the-lost-world-finally-revealed", "countriesMentioned": ["Australia", "United States", "Kazakhstan"], "author": "Quentin Cooper"},{"newsText": "For the first 12 days, you go about your life normally, unaware that these may very well be your last.  Then at around day 13, the virus erupts out of infected cells and pours into your blood stream. Fever, headache, vomiting and intense body aches leave you too sick to function. At this point, however, there\u2019s still hope: perhaps you\u2019ve just contracted the flu.  Around day 17, however, those prayers are dashed. The first telltale spots begin to break out on your tongue and inside your mouth. These quickly spread across your body, concentrating in the extremities. The pea-sized bumps soon fill with a thick liquid \u2013 the detritus of your ravaged tissues \u2013 and develop a donut-like indentation. For those who dare touch them, they feel like small pebbles embedded under the skin. If you survive \u2013 and 30% of people do not \u2013 the papules will form a crust, eventually falling off as scabs and leaving you with life-long pitted scars.  That\u2019s what happens when you are infected by Variola major virus \u2013 better known as smallpox. An estimated 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th Century alone, making it one of history\u2019s biggest ever viral killers.  Thankfully, however, smallpox was stamped out more than three decades ago, and now there are only a few samples of smallpox left on Earth. Where are they? Why are they there? And could 2014 be the year that we finally destroy the last of this killer virus once and for all?  In 1975, the last naturally occurring case of Variola major turned up in a two-year old girl in Bangladesh. Finally, after three decades of eradication efforts, on 8 May\u00a0 1980, the World Health Organization pronounced success, writing: \u201cThe world and its peoples have won freedom from smallpox, which was a most devastating disease sweeping in epidemic form through many countries since earliest time, leaving death, blindness and disfigurement in its wake.\u201d  This was possible because unlike most deadly viruses \u2013 such as Ebola, yellow fever, HIV, or influenza \u2013 smallpox has no animal reservoir. Without human incubators, the virus cannot naturally exist.  It also doesn\u2019t stay alive on its own for long. In the past, some researchers and news outlets speculated that smallpox in the frozen graves of former victims might remain in suspended animation, ready to begin a new cycle of infection should those bodies ever be dug up and thawed. Scientists have attempted to excavate corpses in frozen graves in Alaska and Siberia that contain the remains of smallpox victims, however none of the bodies contained viable viruses. \u201cNo one feels there\u2019s a serious chance that global warming will melt the permafrost and unleash an epidemic,\u201d says Michael Lane, who served as director of the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s (CDC) smallpox eradication programme from 1970 until 1981, when it was declared a success and shut down.  **Chilling case**  After smallpox was eradicated from the environment, a handful of labs across the world kept live samples of the disease for research purposes, such as developing treatments and vaccines. In 1978, however, the dangers became clear. Janet Parker, a photographer working at the University of Birmingham Medical School, began complaining about headache and muscle pains. Days later, red spots appeared on her body, which medical workers wrote off as a harmless rash. Two weeks after her symptoms began, however, doctors correctly diagnosed smallpox. She was quarantined and treated for her illness, but died around two weeks later. Her mother also fell ill but survived, while her father suffered a fatal heart attack during a visit to see his daughter in the hospital.  Parker had somehow been exposed to the virus, which had likely traveled through air ducts to her office from a lab downstairs where researchers kept samples of smallpox. Henry Bedson, the head of the university\u2019s medical microbiology department, blamed himself for Parker\u2019s death and cut his throat several days before Parker passed away.  This distressing series of events triggered a complete rethink about keeping stores of the smallpox virus for research. \u201cAlthough we all had in the back of our minds that we needed to extirpate the virus \u2013 not just the disease \u2013 that incident made us realise that the repository of smallpox in test tubes and screw-top vials in various labs was a major problem,\u201d Lane says.  The World Health Organization quietly put out a call for all samples of the virus to be either destroyed or sent to one of two official repositories: a CDC lab near Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Siberia. A handful of samples quickly came in, arriving from India, Japan, the UK and other locations. \u201cIt very quickly became obvious that nobody wanted the virus in their lab anyway,\u201d Lane says. \u201cThey were delighted to give this stuff up.\u201d  **Viral tomb   **   Currently, smallpox is known to be kept only at those two locations. (While previously unknown vials were discovered in a Washington lab in July 2014, they were soon transported to Atlanta.) Both house the virus in biosafety level four (BSL-4) facilities. This level of safety \u2013 the highest possible \u2013 requires researchers to wear a positive pressure suit that resembles those worn in space and includes a tethered air supply. All manipulation with the virus, which is stored in liquid nitrogen tanks, is done in bio-safety cabinets. When exiting the lab, researchers spend seven minutes in a chemical shower to disinfect themselves, followed by a water rinse. No air escapes from within the BSL-4\u2019s rooms, and each year the CDC lab is shut down for a month to undergo preventative maintenance.  While the CDC is located on the fringes of bustling Atlanta, the Russian smallpox repository, Vector, has an additional safety measure \u2013 it is in the middle of nowhere.  Security at both locations is formidable. \u201cI was director of smallpox programmes for many years, and I live one mile from the CDC,\u201d Lane says. \u201cI can\u2019t even get into the building \u2013 not just the lab \u2013 where smallpox virus is kept.\u201d  Only a small number of researchers are permitted to enter these chambers. For some, it\u2019s just another day on the job. \u201cI cut my teeth working on BSL-4 viruses,\u201d says Peter Jahrling, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease\u2019s Integrated Research Facility, and chief of the Emerging Viral Pathogens Section. \u201cI work with Ebola, Lassa and Marburg, so smallpox is a walk in the park.\u201d  Others, however, maintain a sense of reverence for the disease. \u201cThis is a virus that wreaked terrible havoc on the human population, and efforts to control and eradicate that disease were heroic,\u201d says Inger Damon, chief of the poxvirus and rabies branch at the CDC\u2019s Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. \u201cI don\u2019t think you ever become immune to that sense of awe.\u201d  **Nowhere else?   **   So how do we know that additional smallpox samples are not also hoarded away in some terrorist hideout, or stuck in an old vial in the back of a forgotten freezer? \u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d Lane says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to prove a negative.\u201d  Still, things look good for the disease\u2019s confinement to the CDC and Vector. Since the late 1970s, as far as experts know, no one has contracted smallpox. At the same time, no terrorists have come forward claiming they have the virus and no rumours have circulated of it being kept in some secret lab.  Except, that is, for one suspicious case. In 1992, Ken Alibek \u2013 formerly Colonel Kanatzhan Alibekov \u2013 defected from Russia to the US. Alibek served as the first deputy director of Biopreparat, the Soviet Union\u2019s biological warfare agency, founded in 1973. After arriving in the US, Alibek began making allegations against his former nation, claiming that the Soviet Union had produced 50 tons of smallpox. Biopreparat, he claimed, had employed a scientific army of 30,000 people who worked on smallpox and other pathogenic weapons, such as Ebola, anthrax and plague.  Could this be true? \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that smallpox virus was developed as a biological weapon and produced on an industrial scale,\u201d Jahrling says. \u201cIs it possible that someone kept a little retirement package in his freezer? It\u2019s not impossible.\u201d  But some \u2013 including Lane \u2013 doubt Alibek\u2019s claims, and point out there\u2019s no evidence. \u201cThe fact that nobody knows for sure whether this happened is the major factor that makes people nervous, even though there\u2019s no solid reason to believe it,\u201d says Lane.  **Last to go**  Now the last remaining virus samples in Atlanta and Russia might finally be headed for eradication.  This summer, the World Health Assembly \u2013 which acts as a sort of congress for the WHO \u2013 will vote about whether or not to destroy the remaining smallpox samples. The Russian delegation has consistently voted against this path, so there is a chance that Russia would not comply if the vote turned in favour of destroying the virus. For the US, however, \u201cit would be extremely embarrassing for us not to go along with the official WHO recommendation,\u201d Lane says. \u201cWe\u2019d basically be thumbing our nose at the UN.\u201d  The Russians are not alone in wanting to keep smallpox. Some scientists say that more research needs to be done on the complex genetics of the virus, which could help devise more effective antivirals, for example. \u201cI know many in this country feel there\u2019s important research to be done, and that it really doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to acquiesce to some symbolic act,\u201d Jahrling says.  Damon also sees the logic in keeping smallpox around. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind many times, and when I first came to this position at CDC, I didn\u2019t really see a need to use the live virus,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think if we\u2019re going to develop a better understanding of the virus, having access to it is critical.\u201d  Dissenters, on the other hand, claim that most of that work can be done with the much less virulent Vaccinia virus or other related viruses. \u201cIt almost becomes a theological argument: either you believe you need it or you don\u2019t,\u201d Jahrling says.  Wouldn\u2019t destroying it make certain once and for all that it\u2019d never fall into the wrong hands though? The truth is, even it were destroyed, existing lab techniques could in principle recreate it based on the smallpox genome, which has been sequenced.  That begs the question: why hasn\u2019t anyone done that already? If a terrorist group, say, did have the means of creating smallpox, the effort may not be worth it compared with other methods of terrorism, such as the use of chemical weapons, says Lane. Vaccines exist to contain smallpox\u2019s spread, and it isn\u2019t the most contagious of pathogens. A smallpox outbreak would no doubt be a catastrophe, but there are worse things that could be unleashed on a population. We beat smallpox once and we could beat it again.  For now, at least, smallpox lives on \u2013 somewhere deep inside two very special labs; the only two places left on Earth where one of history\u2019s biggest killers still thrives.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Smallpox: Last refuge of an ultimate killer", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140130-last-refuge-of-an-ultimate-killer", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "British Indian Ocean Territory", "Japan", "Bangladesh", "United Kingdom", "Germany", "United States", "Australia"], "author": "Rachel Nuwer"},{"newsText": "The polar vortex currently sweeping across the North American continent is bringing with it scenes usually associated with the Arctic or Antarctic. Massive snowfall and violent winds have plummeted temperatures down to record lows. In some areas of the US, such as the state of Indiana, all but essential emergency vehicles are banned from the roads. People are being urged to remain inside in the warm.  The human body is not designed for polar cold \u2013 most of us live in temperate and tropical climes, where the mercury rarely dips below freezing. There are populations that have adapted to polar extremes \u2013 like the Inuit in Arctic Canada and tribes like the Nenets in the north of Russia \u2013 but the vast majority of Homo sapiens has no experience of living in such sub-zero temperatures. And while our ingenuity and expertise has allowed us to create clothing to withstand all but the most violent Arctic blizzards, polar survival is all about keeping out of the most fearsome cold unless you absolutely have to.  What happens when we get cold? The human body has several defence mechanisms to try and boost our core temperature when it gets chilly. Our muscles shiver and teeth chatter. Our hairs rise and our flesh forms \u201cgoosebumps\u201d \u2013 a kind of evolutionary echo from the times when our ancestors were covered in fur. The hypothalamus, the gland in the brain that acts as your body\u2019s thermostat, stimulates these reactions to keep the body\u2019s vital organs warm, at least until it can find some kind of warmth and shelter.  The hypothalamus\u2019s mission is to keep the core warm at all costs \u2013 sacrificing the extremities if need be. That\u2019s why we feel pins and needles in our fingers and toes in extreme cold \u2013 the body is keeping its warm blood close to the centre, constricting blood supply in the outer regions such as the end of our limbs. In extreme cold, and especially if bare skin is open to the elements, this effect can end in frostbite. Blood flow is reduced, and the lack of warm blood can lead to tissue freezing and rupturing.  So how do other warm-blooded animals living in such climes cope when we can\u2019t? Polar animals are either covered in winter coats of fur \u2013 which traps warm air close to the body \u2013 or else large quantities of fat, sometimes inches thick. Fat does not transfer heat very well, so it keeps it inside the body. Humans, with naked skin and relatively little fat, just aren\u2019t built for these environments.  But we have learned to mimic these qualities. Scientists in Antarctic stations, for instance, dress in layers upon layers, which traps warm air close to the body like fur does.  The other problem with the kind of weather currently affecting the US is that it can create problems with some of the things mankind relies on. Intense cold can bring down power lines due to the weight of ice, cutting power supply. Uninsulated pipes can freeze and burst. And cars? The freezing point of petrol is around -60C (-76C), but oil is around -40C (-40F), and other lubricants can thicken at less than that. Diesel normally clogs at much warmer temperatures \u2013 around -10C (14F) \u2013 unless it has special additives to enable it to remain viscous in cold temperatures.  There are some sobering stories from history to warn us of the dreadful effects of such cold. When Hitler\u2019s armies invaded Russia in 1941, the early winter saw temperatures dropping to similar levels as we are seeing in the US. Many thousands of soldiers froze to death, still wearing the summer uniforms of what was expected to be a short campaign. Truck and tank engines froze solid, and could only be thawed out by lighting fires underneath them. Guns could not be fired because the grease had fused solid. Boiling water taken off the fire would freeze solid in little more than a minute. Italian journalist Curzio Malaparte recalled in his novel Kaputt seeing Eastern Front veterans disembarking in then-occupied Warsaw; the soldier had all had their eyelids frozen off due to the extreme cold.  The recent freezing temperatures have allowed people to indulge in one bizarre scientific quirk from such cold weather \u2013 the Mpemba effect. It is named after the Tanzanian schoolboy who first suggested that boiling water actually freezes quicker than cold water. As this video shows, it can have some quite spectacular effects.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook or Google+ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - What effect does extreme cold have on the human body?", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140107-what-extreme-cold-does-to-human", "countriesMentioned": ["Russian Federation", "Poland", "United States"], "author": "Stephen Dowling"},{"newsText": "Millions of maggots squirm over blackened pieces of fruit and bloody lumps of fetid flesh. A pungent stench of festering decay hovers over giant vats of writhing, feasting larvae. It's more than enough to put most people off their lunch. Yet these juvenile flies could soon be just one step in the food chain away from your dinner plate.  Such nausea-inducing scenes are daily occurrences at a test site owned by AgriProtein, a South African company which began building what it says will be the world's largest fly farm a few weeks ago. Others in the US, France, Canada and the Netherlands are also gearing up for large-scale farming of insects to feed chicken, pigs and farmed fish.  Hundreds of people attended the Insects to Feed the World conference in Wageningen in the Netherlands earlier this month. Many of them are convinced that bugs can provide a sustainable alternative to more conventional but increasingly expensive cereals, fishmeal and soybeans.  While it may be normal for chickens scratching around a farmyard to gobble up grubs and bugs, until now no-one has taken it to an industrial scale or fed insects to animals that eat other foods in the wild. So can consumers stomach the idea of tucking into smoked salmon, chicken burgers and pork chops that come from maggot-fed animals?  The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that population growth and increased demand for meat and fish will require 70% more feed for cattle by 2050. This will put extra strain on arable land, and further pressure on fish stocks; currently, a third of the fish landed gets turned into meal to feed animals. And the cost of feeding livestock has soared. \"Ingredients for traditional animal feeds are becoming increasingly expensive, especially fishmeal because of over-exploitation of the oceans,\" says Arnold van Huis, an entomologist at Wageningen University, and co-author of The Insect Cookbook, an English translation of which was published in March. \"Cereals are used but the nutritional profile of plant proteins is not good enough. Soya is high in protein but prices have also risen sharply. We need alternatives.\"  It is hardly surprising that entrepreneurs are investigating new possibilities.  AgriProtein announced earlier this month that it had raised $11m to build its first two commercial-scale farms. The first, in Cape Town, will create 20 tonnes of larvae and 20 tonnes of fertiliser per day.  It uses three species \u2013 the black soldier fly, the blowfly and the common housefly. Each is adapted to feed on different types of waste, and their meals include leftover or spoiled food, manure and abattoir waste. Males and females are bred in giant cages and their eggs are extracted and mixed with its food. One kilogram of eggs turns into around 380kg of larvae in just three days. The larvae are then extracted, dried and milled, leaving behind nitrogen-rich material for compost.  AgriProtein\u2019s Magmeal product is approved as a feed for chickens and fish in South Africa. The company is also preparing to apply for approval for an iron- rich product made from larvae fed on blood and guts for use as an additive for breeding sows; piglets aren\u2019t born with enough iron, and in the wild animals usually get what they need from soil. In captivity, they need iron supplements. AgriProtein hope their product will be cheaper.  AgriProtein is not alone. The Vancouver-based Enterra Feed Corporation hope to triple production of black soldier fly larvae products for pet food and eventually for aquaculture feed by next summer. EnviroFlight, based in Ohio in the US, also produces feed for farmed fish made from black soldier fly larvae. Ynsect hopes to be farming mealworms and black soldier flies near Paris on a large scale by 2016. And Protix Biosystems in the Netherlands is now planning to expand its black soldier fly farming operation, selling larvae lipids for use in animal feed, and protein to pet food manufacturers.  Laws in some regions, however, are currently preventing insect-feed taking off. In the European Union, insects fall under the same rules as traditional livestock once they have been killed, dried or otherwise processed. That means their protein can be fed to pets but not to animals destined for human consumption. Even if this was to be changed, other regulations state that farmed animals cannot be fed on catering waste or manure. These regulations, drawn up in the wake of the 1990s BSE crisis, were never intended to apply to insects.  The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers in Brussels is working towards allowing insect meal to be fed to farmed fish. But this is likely to take a year.  Different laws apply in different US states. Insect-based ingredients in feed given to animals bred for human consumption are allowed in Ohio, and manufacturers are hopeful that other states will follow their lead. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is also considering allowing protein and fats from insect larvae to be used in aquaculture and chicken feed.  There are differing views on the speed with which the law should be revised.  \"Some want to work with all kinds of risky material like manure or human faeces to open up the whole thing at once,\" says Kees Aarts of Protix Biosystems. \"It's a bridge too far. It is also important that the industry does not over-sell itself. Insects can play an important role in providing a new source of nutrients in a world of growing demand, but they cannot solve all the big problems we're facing all at once.\"  Will consumers accept maggot-fed food? Many may not care \u2013 after all, the realities of industrial food production are already hidden from view for most people. And Jason Drew, who runs Agriprotein with his brother David, is convinced that a combination of the environmental benefits and the \"back to nature\" message will win over squeamish customers. \"Out in the fields, the natural diet of chickens consists of flies, larvae, worms and ants, and wild- caught trout gets its protein from insects,\" he says. \"That's why they jump out of the water. What we're doing is going back to an entirely natural process, and that's something people understand very quickly. Ten-to-15 years from now this will be a very big global industry.\"  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - How insects could feed the food industry of tomorrow", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140603-are-maggots-the-future-of-food", "countriesMentioned": ["Canada", "France", "Belgium", "United States", "Netherlands", "Panama"], "author": "Nic Fleming"},{"newsText": "A \u201cdeafening silence\u201d is a striking absence of noise, so profound that it seems to have its own quality. Objectively it is impossible for one silence to be any different from another. But the way we use the phrase hints at a psychological truth.  The secret to a deafening silence is the period of intense noise that comes immediately before it. When this ends, the lack of sound appears quieter than silence. This sensation, as your mind tries to figure out what your ears are reporting, is what leads us to call a silence deafening.  What is happening here is a result of a process called adaptation. It describes the moving baseline against which new stimuli are judged. The way the brain works is that any constant simulation is tuned out, allowing perception to focus on changes against this background, rather than absolute levels of stimulation. Turn your stereo up from four to five and it sounds louder, but as your memory of making the change rapidly fades, your mind adjusts and volume five becomes the new normal.  Adaptation doesn't just happen for hearing. The brain networks that process all other forms of sensory information also pull the same trick. Why can't you see the stars during the daytime? They are still there, right? You can't see them because your visual system has adapted to the light levels from the sun, making the tiny variation in light that a star makes against the background of deep space invisible. Only after dark does your visual system adapt to a baseline at which the light difference created by a star is meaningful.  Just as adaption applies across different senses, so too does the after- effect, the phenomenon that follows it. Once the constant stimulation your brain has adapted to stops, there is a short period when new stimuli appear distorted in the opposite way from the stimulus you've just been experiencing. A favourite example is the waterfall illusion. If you stare at a waterfall (here's one) for half a minute and then look away, stationary objects will appear to flow upwards. You can even pause a video and experience the illusion of the waterfall going into reverse.  It's a phenomenon called the motion after effect. You can get them for colour perception or for just lightness-darkness (which is why you sometimes see dark spots after you've looked at the sun or a camera flash).  After-effects also apply to hearing, which explains why a truly deafening silence comes immediately after the brain has become adapted to a high baseline of noise. We perceive this lack of sound as quieter than other silences for the same reason that the waterfall appears to suck itself upwards.  So while it is true that all silences are physically the same, perhaps Spinal Tap lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel was onto something with his amplifier dials that go up to 11. When it comes to the way we perceive volume, it is sometimes possible to drop below zero.  _If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our _Facebook page_ or message us on _Twitter_._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Why deafening silence sounds different to other silence", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130816-the-sound-of-deafening-silence", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "Tom Stafford"},{"newsText": "The buzz of excitement is audible. But when the players arrive, the game soon descends into chaos. They barely seem able to tell one foot from the other; one player falls head over heels while another hides on the side-lines. Finally, the striker lines himself up... shoots... and scores. And the game ends.  No, this bumbling behaviour isn\u2019t from the shellshocked Brazilian side. The players are bees trained by Felicity Muth, who researches animal behaviour at the University of Nevada in Reno. The bees\u2019 performance \u2013 as clumsy as it may be \u2013 is just the latest example of their amazing intellects. For a sweet reward of sugar water, bumblebees and honeybees have mastered a range of skills, including an ability to count, find a quick route out of a maze, and even tell the difference between cubist and impressionist paintings. Indeed, one group of honeybees seemed to master multiple abstract concepts, such as colours and arrangement of objects, quicker than our primate relatives. This is despite them having a brain the size of a grass seed. Learning to dribble a ball across a pitch may have been simple in comparison.  The idea originated while Muth was watching the World Cup in her lab. To coax her bees into playing, Muth first covered a small pompom with pollen. \u201cIt's their only source of protein and they need it to feed their larvae,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have such a strong drive to collect it.\u201d Muth then filmed their antics as they chased the ball around the pitch, and into the goal.  As impressive as they are, these bumblebees can\u2019t claim to be the first insects to play the beautiful game; that may go to a team ants lured into playing soccer last year. But if their other skills are anything to go by, they may be the smartest. And who knows? Maybe one day we will see the two species battle it out on pitch. Let the Insect World Cup commence.

The New Horizons spacecraft has travelled 5bn km (3bn miles) over nine years to get near the dwarf planet.  And with 200m km still to go, its images of Pluto will show only a speck of light against the stars.  But the data will be critical in helping to align the probe properly for what will be just a fleeting fly-by.  Pluto will be photographed repeatedly during the approach, to determine the probe's position relative to the dwarf planet, explained Mark Holdridge, from the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) in Baltimore.  \"We then perform a number of correction manoeuvres to realign our trajectory with the reference trajectory, thus ensuring we hit our aim point to travel through the Pluto system,\" he said.  Any initial correction is likely to be made in March.  Image copyright NASA/esa/m.Showalter/seti Image caption The Pluto system has five known moons. Others may be discovered in the coming months  When New Horizons arrives at Pluto it will be moving so fast - at almost 14km/s - that going into orbit around the distant world is impossible; it must barrel straight through instead.  One complication is that the seven different instruments aboard the spacecraft need to work at different distances to get their data, and so the team has constructed a very elaborate observation schedule for them all.  But what this means is that very precise timing will be required to make sure the flyby runs smoothly.  The closest approach to Pluto is set for around 11:50 GMT on 14 July - at a miss distance of roughly 13,695km from the surface.  Mission planners want the exact timings nailed to within 100 seconds. New Horizons will know then where and when to point the instruments.  * * *  ## Dwarf Planet Pluto - Demoted but undiminished  Image copyright NASA/ESA/M.Buie/sri Image caption Hubble's best is a synthetic composite of multiple views. What are those shapes?    * Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh on 18 February 1930   * It is named after the Roman god of the underworld    * An average of 5.9bn km from Sun and orbits every 248 years   * Measuring its diameter is difficult but roughly 2,300km   * It has a thin nitrogen atmosphere that comes and goes   * * *  The Pluto mission is being billed as the last great encounter in planetary exploration.  For people who grew up with the idea that there were \"nine planets\", this is the moment they get to complete the set.  Robotic probes have been to all the others, even the distant Uranus and Neptune. Pluto is the last of the \"classical nine\" to receive a visit.  Of course, this 2,300km-wide ice-covered rock was demoted in 2006 to the status of mere \"dwarf planet\", but scientists say that should not dull our enthusiasm.  The dwarfs are the most numerous planetary class in the Solar System, and Nasa's New Horizons probe is one of the first opportunities to study an example up close.  The first set of navigation pictures may not be anything special, but by May, the probe will be returning views of Pluto that are better than anything from Hubble. Come July, the view should be spectacular, said Andy Cheng, the principal investigator on the probe's main camera, which is called LORRI.  Media playback is unsupported on your device  Media captionAs Rebecca Morelle reports, even the Hubble Space Telescope could only capture blurry images of Pluto  \"The most recent surprise we had was with the Rosetta mission. Hubble had made a 'shape model' of Comet 67P but no-one expected it to look like a rubber duckie,\" he told BBC News. \"I am more than hopeful that we will get similar surprises with New Horizons - it's what we should expect.\"  Those surprises could include yet more moons (five are currently known) and possibly even rings like those seen around some of the bigger planets.  Pluto is currently 5bn km from Earth. It has taken New Horizons more than nine years to get to the dwarf's doorstep.  Once the flyby is complete, the probe will be targeted at an even more distant object in the Kuiper Belt - the name given to the icy domain beyond the main planets. Scientists think this region of space, and beyond, may contain many thousands of Pluto-like objects. Some even speculate there are far-flung worlds that rival Mars and Earth in size.  The first optical navigation images should be back on Earth by Tuesday at the latest. They will show Pluto with its largest moon, Charon.

Think Elon Musk and his revolutionary electric car, the Tesla Model S, or Richard Branson, and his plans to send tourists into space.  But this isn\u2019t always the way. Sometimes, big ideas can come from more humble, though no less ambitious origins (such as the Sky Whale we featured recently). With this in mind, a design challenge looking for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in transport is asking students to come up with revolutionary ideas.  \u201cIn the year 2030, at a time in which city driving is done autonomously due to high urban density, \u2018driving for pleasure\u2019 adventures will be found outside the cities,\u201d states the entry form for the Michelin Challenge Design 2015 competition.  The contest is \u201clooking to recognise simple and sustainable vehicle designs best suited for your chosen adventure on an iconic road that would exhibit pure driving pleasure\u201d.  But why seek ideas from students, when established engineers and designers could come up with something new?  \u201cStudents don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know,\u201d says Ben Ebel of Michelin, leader on the Michelin Challenge Design Steering Team. His enthusiasm for the project is obvious. He says that students don\u2019t have the same jaded eye that they might after spending time in the industry. \u201cTime after time we see that [students] are exceptional futurists,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are exceptionally good at predicting trends.\u201d  In some ways transport design could be compared with human evolution. We\u2019ve gone down one particular path, which we continue to refine. There\u2019s no particular reason things could not have evolved in a different way though, we could have six limbs instead of four, and cars could have six wheels. But unlike humans, cars can go back to the drawing board.  Winners of the previous competition in 2014 illustrate this flexibility in thinking. The challenge was to explore developments in vehicle autonomy., the winner being a vehicle named BOT, designed by Chris Luchowiec from Poland. He graduated from the Lahti Institute of Design in Finland with a degree in industrial design, and the autonomous transport device he came up with is perfectly suited to areas like Finland with relatively low population numbers. BOT is supposed to give people the functionality of a car, but without having to own one. It is basically a self-driving taxi, which can be used alone, or the ride can be shared.  The vehicle looks futuristic; it may still have four wheels but they have been pushed to the far corners, and the cabin is a square-shaped box. But what really impressed the jury, according to Ebel, is the way the BOT vehicle externally communicated what it was doing, with simple headlight graphics which display the \u2018mood\u2019 of the car and driver  They are circular, so look almost like eyes, that can blink or wink. The designer says the plan was to make the vehicle look friendly. He does not believe that cars that automatically cruise city streets should look aggressive, but should be \u2018humble helpers\u2019.\u00a0 The lighting colour of the vehicle is changeable too, so for example the whole thing can glow gently yellow at night, which the designer says would help people chill out after a long day at work.  It is public transport that can be personalised.  \u201cI think that is something that we are always going to see a need for,\u201d says Ebel. \u201cTechnology partnered with a way that the car (or transportation device) can still say something about the person driving it. There is a system there so that you can still present a message to the world.\u201d  Another favourite of Ebel\u2019s is GelenK, which came in third. This vehicle is designed for freight, not people, and was created by South Korean designer Takbeom  \u201cI think that subset of transportation is really going to be a place where autonomy is really going to be very successful,\u201d he says. ****  Freight deliveries often include repeated routes, with well-planned stops, and so would be an easier application of autonomy than a demanding, unpredictable, human passenger.  GelenK looks like a small white double-decker bus, or a slightly streamlined RV, but much narrower. Its small size means it can zip around city streets where conventional lorries would struggle to fit \u2013 showing the student\u2019s ability to think outside the box, even when moving boxes.  How likely is it that these ambitious designs will leap from the drawing board to our roads? Ebel believes the ideas will eventually filter through, adding that there\u2019s good reason for taking these ideas seriously**.**  \u201cIt\u2019s vital for us to anticipate and understand the market,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have found that these participants are incredibly good at giving us an insight into what consumers are going to be looking for in the next 5, 10, or 15 years.\u201d  For budding designers with a desire for shaping the transport of the future, the competition is open now for entries, until June 2014.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - The design contest creating radical transport concepts", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140317-outsider-ideas-for-2030-transport", "countriesMentioned": ["Finland", "Poland", "United States"], "author": "Jack Stewart"},{"newsText": "Forget surveillance cameras \u2013 what if our world were filled with always-on electronic noses tuned to detect all manner of contraband at minute concentrations? Drugs, explosives, air pollution, all of them could be monitored continuously, creating a \"smell portrait\" of the entire planet, and making it virtually impossible to conceal the trace odour of many legal and illegal substances.  That's the vision of scientists who work on electronic noses, and now, thanks to the silkmoth, the world's most sensitive electronic nose for explosives was recently demonstrated in the lab. One thousand times more sensitive than comparable devices, it consists of a tiny, vibrating cantilever coated in a forest of titanium dioxide nanotubes that were inspired by similar structures on the antennae of silkmoths.  Male silkmoths can detect females at distances of 5-10 kilometres (3-6 miles), and can register as few as one or two molecules of their pheromone scent. Five years ago, Denis Spitzer of the defence-focused Institut Franco-Allemand de Recherches de Saint-Louis heard about the super-sensitive feats of the silkmoth and wondered whether this could be reproduced by a machine.  One of the keys to the moth's performance is that its antennae are covered with a carpet of tiny sensilla, or microscopic fibres. These sensilla give the moth's detection apparatus much greater surface area than they would otherwise have, which is important for detecting very small concentrations of volatile compounds. These sensilla inspired Spitzer to upgrade an existing solution to \"smelling\" compounds with silicon.  Cantilevers \u2013 which, under high magnification, look like tiny diving boards \u2013 are a tried and true method for detecting target substances in air. Coated with a substance to which target molecules will attach themselves selectively, driven by a piezoelectric actuator, these tiny silicon rectangles vibrate at a high frequency, and when a molecule of the target substance sticks to them, the frequency of their vibration changes.  By covering a typical cantilever with titanium dioxide nanotubes, Spitzer and his team were able to increase its surface area 100-fold, and multiply its sensitivity by a factor of 1,000.  \"For me, this is bioinspiration, not biomimicry,\" says Spitzer. The moth detects molecules through a \"lock and key\" system in which individual molecules are caught by smell sensor receptors, which then activate neurons connected to the animal's brain. Spitzer's system works by a very different mechanism, but this insight from the physical structure of the moth's antennae proved to be a crucial one.  Currently, this electronic nose can detect traces of TNT and related compounds as low as parts per million or less, because the titanium dioxide coating likes to bond with molecules of these explosives. Spitzer estimates it will be 2-4 years before this system will make it into the real world, but he already has plans to test it outside the lab. Future research efforts will be aimed at making the device even more sensitive, as well as making it selective for a host of other compounds, including drugs and pollutants.  Ultimately, notes Spitzer, this sensor's real competition will be the drug and bomb-sniffing dogs employed by law enforcement the world over. Presently, no electronic system is more sensitive than a well-trained sniffer dog, but Spitzer thinks that he can create something that will be as sensitive as these animals, while overcoming their one shortfall: after an hour, a dog's nose becomes saturated with the target substance, making them less useful.  \"This kind of detector can work continuously,\" says Spitzer. \"The principle is that it's reusable. You just heat the system and the TNT goes away.\"  Ultra-sensitive, continuously operating, and as cheap to mass-produce as current silicon microchips, that's the sort of device that will transform the surveillance state into one which can see, hear \u2013 and smell.  _If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - How silkmoths could defeat terrorism and drug smuggling", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120828-smelling-lessons-from-silkmoths", "countriesMentioned": [], "author": "Christopher Mims"},{"newsText": "![Pluto](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/80798000/jpg/_80798597_pluto.jpg) Image copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SwRI Image caption Pluto (centre) pictured with Charon, taken from a distance of just over 200 million km  The New Horizons probe has returned new pictures of the dwarf planet Pluto and its largest moon, Charon.  They are the first images since the Nasa mission formally began its countdown to a flyby of the distant world in July.  Pluto and its satellite appear as white blobs in the photos, which were taken from a separation of 200 million km.  But come May, New Horizons will return views of the dwarf \u2013 5bn km from Earth - that better anything from the Hubble.  There is not much science that can be done with these early pictures.  Their primary use is to make sure the probe is lined up properly for its historic rendezvous in just over five months.  Controllers will be conducting a number of these optical navigation surveys.  They need to be sure as well that New Horizons is not heading for any debris that may be moving around the Pluto system when it barrels through at 13km/s.  The first of any adjustments in the spacecraft\u2019s trajectory will begin in March.  ## Birthday shot  Nasa released the new image set on the 109th birthday of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the distant icy world in 1930.  The American astronomer died in 1997, but his daughter, Annette Tombaugh, commented: \u201cMy dad would be thrilled with New Horizons.  \"To actually see the planet that he had discovered, and find out more about it - to get to see the moons of Pluto - he would have been astounded.  \u201cI'm sure it would have meant so much to him if he were still alive today.\u201d  Pluto has five known moons. In the new images only Charon shows up in the tenth of a second exposure.  Longer exposures acquired in due course will reveal the other satellites, and perhaps additional objects that are bound gravitationally to Pluto.  The picture shown on this page was taken by New Horizons' Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI).  This is the main telescope and camera system onboard.

I was given access to the team behind the search giant\u2019s self-driving car programme. Part of Google X, the company\u2019s the semi-secret research arm, the crew is usually hidden away from the public eye. I was there to find out what it takes to use this technology, and what it\u2019s like to be a Google test driver; taking a backseat to the car\u2019s computers even when sat behind the steering wheel.  It was an interesting time to observe just how ready driverless cars are for the road. Today, Google announced plans to start building its own vehicles, rather than relying on other manufacturers. So far, Google has fitted its driverless technology into existing cars, such as the Toyota Prius and Lexus RX450hs.  Yet Google\u2019s own vehicles will be cute little city cars with smiling, non- threatening faces, and pedestrian friendly crash features. The company\u2019s reasoning is that if its cars are going to be autonomous, they needn\u2019t follow conventional designs.  Although Google\u2019s new cars are designed to eventually dispense with steering wheels and pedals, at first Google wants to fit the cars with human-specific controls, which can be plugged in and layered on top of the autonomous controls, so that the cars can be safely tested on public roads. They will be very much like the vehicle I travelled in, which has a steering wheel and pedals in case the human driver needs to take over.  They may not touch the controls for the majority of a drive, but they still have to be here, still have to stay constantly alert, scanning the road, watching for mistakes made by their autonomous chauffeurs.  Ultimately, it\u2019s a success if the journeys are as uneventful as possible. \u201cDuring the ride, it\u2019s OK if it\u2019s boring, because that means it\u2019s safe,\u201d says Brian Torcellini, Google\u2019s lead test driver and the man responsible for training other drivers not to drive. He has been with the team since 2009, and was one of the first autonomous car pilots.  Google\u2019s current fleet \u2013 around a couple of dozen cars \u2013 lives at Google\u2019s home base in Mountain View. The Google test drivers are not allowed to take them home. The early blue Toyota Prius vehicles have been replaced with bright white Lexus SUVs. They are easy to spot; they have a rather ungainly laser scanner on the roof, and the company\u2019s logo in primary colours on the side.  \u201cThe drivers check in, just like everyone else would in the morning,\u201d explains Torcellini. \u201cThey take the cars out, run some tests, and then they come back and drop the cars off and upload the data.\u201d  **Trained for extremes**  Google\u2019s drivers have to learn to let the machine do the driving \u2013 but they are also encouraged to be very cautious about the car\u2019s abilities. If they ever feel in the slightest bit uncomfortable with the way the computer is driving, they are told to wrest control away immediately with a tap of a pedal or turn of the steering wheel. Engineers can then collect information from the computers, and extrapolate and simulate what the car would have done. The comparison between the hypothetical action and the human intervention can be used to help improve the car\u2019s software.  Even though they\u2019re supposed to be cautious, the drivers are also trained for the extremes. They take cars through their paces on slaloms and skidpans on a test track, to really experience how they perform at the limit. They are conditions that they\u2019re very unlikely to encounter on the road, but the hope is that if they encounter ice, for instance, the computers will know how to react.  \u201cMost of the driving we do isn\u2019t drifting around cones,\u201d says Torcellini, \u201cbut we feel like the best thing to do is to overtrain our folks.\u201d  So what is it like to sit in a car being driven by a computer? There is certainly no sliding sideways around corners on the day I sat in the back of a Google SUV, one of the company\u2019s first-generation vehicles complete with steering wheel .  It turns out that one of the car\u2019s biggest challenges begins before it hits the road; the drivers have to take to the controls to negotiate our way out of the car park before we hear the soothing female tone of the \u201cautodriving\u201d announcement that tells us the computer is taking over.  **\u2018History in the making\u2019**  \u201cA lot of parking lots, in some ways, are even more complicated than public roads,\u201d explains Alyssa, the safety driver. There are often no proper lane markings, and they are full of people walking in all directions and obstacles like shopping trolleys. It\u2019s the kind of busy, hazard-heavy driving environment humans are instinctively able to process, but that might be less obvious to a computer.  The crew also helps refine the car\u2019s software, by keeping a log of the driving experience, updated on a laptop from the passenger\u2019s seat. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly leaving comments about little things that we think could feel smoother or more human-like,\u201d says Alyssa. Test drives are essential to get to the heart of how the journey feels, for the passengers and the people around. The objective is to make the car\u2019s driving seem natural, to integrate well with other cars, and not feel jerky or hesitant.  The car accelerates at a fair pace, and copes with other traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians, when they appear, cameraphones poised, to get a snap of us whizzing by. Even in Silicon Valley, driverless cars get attention in a way that would make a Ferrari owner jealous \u2013 something the two drivers are by now are used to. \u201cA lot of people do have the view that we have a really cool job \u2013 and we do!\u201d says Loren. \u201cThis is history in the making, and it\u2019s fantastic to be a part of it.\u201d  Torcellini\u2019s advice if you fancy a job driving a car with no steering wheel? \u201cWe are looking for people with good judgment,\u201d he says. That can be hard to establish in just one sit-down interview so the recruitment process is multi- stage, and includes a driving interview. The process is tough, but if the company\u2019s fleet expands as ambitiously as Google\u2019s new announcement suggests, one thing is clear. There\u2019s going to be a need for a lot more human test drivers before we have a world full of computer-controlled cars.  _If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our __Facebook__ or __Google+__ page, or message us on __Twitter__._", "newsHeadline": "BBC - Future - Where Google trains its drivers not to drive", "newsUrl": "http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140527-inside-googles-robot-car-lab", "countriesMentioned": ["Italy"], "author": "Jack Stewart"},{"newsText": "Getting from A to B is very rarely boring in the world of science fiction \u2013 sadly real life is often a let-down in comparison.

But if the hoverbike currently being developed by Los Angeles-based Aerofex, gets off the ground, this could change. It is uncannily reminiscent of a Speeder Bike from the original Star Wars trilogy.  The device is named the Aero-X and it takes up about as much room as a small car. Eventually there will be space for just two passengers though, and early prototypes show only one brave test-rider, who perches on top of two horizontal spinning blades encased in circular housings.  The company calls it a crossover vehicle. It is technically a hovercraft, but it apparently feels like riding a motorbike. It is designed for low-altitude flying, and can zoom over ground that even an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) would struggle with. Aerofex says it will be capable of 72km/h (45mph).  But at a cost of $85,000, who is a crossover hoverbike aimed at, beyond the odd rich eccentric with a head for heights? Although it\u2019s a niche product, the company\u2019s CTO and founder Mark DeRoche told me it could be a lucrative niche. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing between a ground vehicle and an aircraft,\u201d he says, apart from much more expensive helicopters and small planes. Aerofex thinks its vehicle could be useful for farmers, both for agriculture (crops) and herding animals. It could also be used by emergency services, for disaster relief or search and rescue, as well as for border patrols.  None of these people fly aircraft for a living, so the vehicle will have to be easy enough for a non-pilot to fly. The company says that should be possible, and that the rider sits in a position where the vehicle responds to his movements similar to the way a motorcycle would. Aerofex says it has found that, for this type of vehicle, it makes sense to fly up to around 20ft (6m) above the ground.  The concept behind the Aero-X isn\u2019t new,
